# History

Adapted from the original markdown Caz wrote because Sarah wanted to learn React.

The design was somewhat inspired by [Notion](notion.so), which is where the content was once hosted.

This iteration of the project is built on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

Karst is yours to create your own stories with.

# Boring License Stuff

The guiding principal and spirit of this project is to be as "make it yours" as possible. After all, the game is about creating your own stories.

Since the world is a silly place and there are the occasional bad actors in life, the different parts of the game and project have licenses. Also, like most things in life, this project is built on the works of others and some of those works have licenses.

## Third-Party Licensing

As mentioned at the top of this section, we want you to take Karst and make it yours and do what your want with it. The above licenses are really just to prevent someone from taking it away from everyone else or being a jerk.

If you ever want to publish a story or suppliment for Karst, we'd be honored. In turn, all we ask is that you follow our license agreement.

Also, if you every want any story or thing you create to be an official part of Karst or even just linked to, let us know!

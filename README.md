# History

Adapted from the original markdown Caz wrote because Sarah wanted to learn React. 

The design was somewhat inspired by [Notion](notion.so), which is where the content was once hosted.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Boring License Stuff

The guiding principal and spirit of this project is to be as "make it yours" as possible. After all, the game is about creating your own stories.

Since the world is a silly place and there are the occasional bad actors in life, the different parts of the game and project have licenses. Also, like most things in life, this project is built on the works of others and some of those works have licenses.

## Code

The "Code" consists of any file in this project that is written in a programming language, such as Python or JavaScript and its associated dialects.

## Game Content

## Third-Party Licensing

As mentioned at the top of this section, we want you to take Karst and make it yours and do what your want with it. The above licenses are really just to prevent someone from taking it away from everyone else or being a jerk.

If you ever want to publish a story or suppliment for Karst, you totally can, but we just ask that you follow our 3rd-party license found in the [LICENSE-3rd-party.md](LICENSE-3rd-party.md) file.

Also, if you every want any story or thing you create to be an official part of Karst or even just linked to, let us know!

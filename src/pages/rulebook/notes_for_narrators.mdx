It’s the narrator’s job to make the world of Karst feel alive. It may be the player’s characters who are central to the story, but it is the narrator who facilitates the story itself. If this is the role you are playing in the game, you have a greater responsibility than the players– and a potentially greater reward. This chapter aims to give you a few tips and tricks for handling the responsibility and having an enjoyable time in the process.

Above all else: Create problems and opportunities, never solutions– that's for the players.

## Creating Stories

Karst is a game about creating stories. The narrative will grow and evolve based on what the players do, but the foundation is up to you. Some players will want lots of initial plot to bite into, while others want less.

For the former, consider sketching out an adventure with a strong core premise, a few general branches, interesting characters, and scenes before you play. Start the game with a strong hook to lure the players in. You might even tell players a little bit about this hook if you want them to tailor their characters in any specific ways to fit the plot.

For a more open-ended experience, come up with a handful of adventure seeds, encounters, and interesting characters. To easy the task, you may want to borrow from other sources here. Let the players create the characters they want or encourage them to “learn into” their backgrounds as they play. Finally, give them a way to start exploring, such as the beginning of a map or an actual method of transportation– like a boat.

Combining the two types of gameplay, the beginnings of a large adventure could involve a small plot to acquire a vessel before the broader story begins. Again, the best stories are the ones that you and your players enjoy. Your best option is often to just ask your players what type of game they would like to play and go from there.

## Setting the Mood

☼ Soft horror often means leaving the most terrifying bits unspoken.
☼ All seems well, but under the surface, something is terribly wrong here.
☼ Create cracks in the narrative for doubt and fear to come creeping in.
☼ Use comic relief to lighten the mood– and consequences to dampen it.
☼ Themes of hope are not out of place– contrast is good.
☼ Karst is dying but the characters should feel alive.

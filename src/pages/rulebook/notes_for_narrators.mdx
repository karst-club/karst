The narrator makes the world of Karst come alive. The players and their characters may be the ones who are central to the plot, but it’s the narrator who facilitates the story itself. If this is the role you are playing, you have a greater responsibility – and a potentially greater reward. This chapter aims to give you a few tips and tricks for handling these responsibilities while having an enjoyable time in the process. Above all else: **Strive to create problems and opportunities, never solutions – that’s for the players.**

## Creating Stories

Karst is a game about creating stories. The narrative will grow and evolve based on what the players do, but the foundation is up to you. Some players will want lots of initial plot to bite into, while others want less.

For the former, consider sketching out an adventure with a strong core premise, a few general branches, interesting characters, and scenes before you play. Start the game with a strong hook to lure the players in. You might even tell players a little bit about this hook if you want them to tailor their characters in any specific ways to fit the plot. Once the game has started, don’t be afraid to go in different directions than you had anticipated.

For a more open-ended experience, come up with a handful of adventure seeds, encounters, and interesting characters. To simplify this task, you may want to borrow ideas from different sources. Let the players create the characters they want or encourage them to “learn into” their backgrounds as they play. Finally, give them a way to start exploring, such as the beginning of a map or an actual method of transportation, like a boat. Often, an open-ended game will converge upon some kind of larger plot. Don’t hesitate to start planning things out a little bit more if this happens.

Combining the two types of gameplay, the beginnings of a large adventure could involve a small plot to acquire a vessel before the broader story begins.

The nature and themes of the stories you tell are up to you, but the setting does lend itself more to certain kinds of stories than others. Tales of adventure and exploration are probably the most obvious fit, as the archipelago is ripe for discovery. Complex, interpersonal, tales and political intrigue, too, are a good match, especially in certain busy ports of call. Nautical themes abound, but the larger islands of the archipelago are home to open plains and snowcapped mountains. Unifying it all is a faint sense of unease – there is optimism, but this place is doomed.

Of course, the best stories are the ones that you and your players enjoy. Your best option is often to just ask your players what type of game they would like to play and go from there.

## Setting the Mood

☼ Soft horror often means leaving the most terrifying bits unspoken.
☼ All seems well, but under the surface, something is terribly wrong here.
☼ Create cracks in the narrative for doubt and fear to come creeping in.
☼ Use comic relief to lighten the mood – and consequences to dampen it.
☼ Themes of hope are not out of place – contrast is good.
☼ Karst is dying but the characters should feel alive.

## Scenes and Altercations

When running scenes and especially altercations, you will often need to keep things moving. Try not to let the players get too caught up in one thing, unless the whole group is interested and it adds to the story. In a similar manner, it’s up to you to cut to the chase. Don’t waste time drawing out events or playing through what happens between more impactful scenes, but also don’t hand wave it all away – a short description of what happened in the interim can make transition between scenes more natural.

Another way in which you can keep the story flowing is by not calling for action rolls very often, especially for things that they have the knack, an ability, or item for. This has the added benefit of encouraging creative problem solving and empowering the players characters. When the players think in terms of who their characters are rather than what statistics represent them, the story comes alive.

## Everyone Else

The opposition, friends, bystanders, and neutral parties, too – almost everyone but the player’s characters – are your responsibility to embody. Remember, each of these characters has their own life and motivations. It can be difficult to juggle every last character in addition to all of your other tasks, so consider jotting down a few words about any characters the players may interact with beforehand. Even a word or two describing their motivations or personality can go a long way towards making a character feel more lifelike and easing what you have to come up with on the spot.

Characters are complex but you can’t be expected to prepare their every reaction and response beforehand. Take advantage of the fact that folk often act in a surprising manner as you come up with responses to the players’ actions – they don’t need to know what you have and haven’t prepared in advance, nor will they usually be able to tell.

A note about characters in altercations. An important thing to remember is that very few folk or creatures will fight to the death, nor will they fight fair. Don’t forget to roll for morale when things start going poorly for the opposition, and don’t be afraid to have them fight dirty – the players will be too.

## Others

While many of the characters that the players encounter will be folk, there are other creatures, beings, beasts, and monsters in the world. Collectively, these characters are known as Others. Most others can be described by a handful of words and a few statistics, such as health, defense, attack damage, and any special behaviors.

You can find a number of others in the Appendix and other publications of the **Karst Archipelago Historical Society** or easily convert them from other games and systems.

## Travel & Time

Much of the logistics of timekeeping is left up to your tastes, but a simple method of tracking time is to assume that characters can spend about eight hours a day actively adventuring. Those who wish to push on can adventure for up to twelve hours, but will be fatigued the next day, subtracting one from all rolls.

To keep things simple, it can also be assumed that all activities take at least one hour to do. Some activities may take multiple hours – such as journeys over land or sea, which can be measured in hours or days, as appropriate.

At a smaller scale, certain activities can be broken down into ten minute intervals, something that can be useful when exploring enclosed spaces. The length of a scene or altercation is left deliberately vague and flexible. Rounds within an altercation can be assumed to last somewhere around ten seconds, but even as long as a minute or two in some situations.

## Awarding Experience

There are no hard and fast rules about when and how to award experience to players and characters. Karst does not have a complicated or detailed method of tracking character experience beyond level, so you will have to use a bit of your own judgement.

As the story is the central building block in Karst, it can be easiest to tie character advancement to the completion of a specific story. The conclusion of an adventure – or shortly thereafter – is often the most logical time for such improvements to occur, anyway. Other times, it may make sense for characters to advance midway through a larger story – again, often after some important accomplishment or plot development.

Characters in Karst are designed to grow from the first level to the tenth level across the entirety of their career. While this should not be an issue for most games, you may need to keep this in mind for particularly long running games. Often you will find that by the time their characters have reached the upper levels, your players will want to move onto to something new, but if not there are ways you can keep the game going. Characters can retire, but there’s also nothing stopping you from playing beyond the tenth level. If you need more content, there are plenty of games out there with higher level spells and abilities that are ripe for conversion into Master knacks, available only to characters above the tenth level.

## Magic Items

Advancing in level isn’t the only way that characters can become more powerful. Magic items are another form of reward, as well as an opportunity for storytelling and world building. Adventures can center around magical items, including quests to recover them, or missions to prevent their misuse. These powerful pieces of plot are a great incentive, excuse, or reward to entice, cajole, or delight your players.

Mechanically, magic items behave in a straightforward manner and they are easy to come up with on the fly. Broadly, there are two types of magic items, those that grant modifiers and those that grant powers. Some magic items grant both modifiers and powers or more than one of each, though these are considerably more rare. Modifiers typically match the item’s function, though there are exceptions. Most powers granted by magic items have similar effects to specific spells and may be used some finite number of times, or a finite number of times per day in the case of more powerful items.

Not all magic items are beneficial. Some are cursed, while others may offer a dubious mix of boons and banes. A magical item may grant one or more negative modifiers or have negative effects. Cursed items are often deceptive and difficult to remove once equipped – magic or a strong will may be needed to lift their curse.

## Treasure

Magic items aren’t the only form of treasure characters can find, even if they are the most exciting. Jewelry, gems, coins, and other precious items are other “common” forms of treasure. The monetary value of these treasures can be tailored to fit the scope of your story, but many treasures are priceless – to the right folk. These treasures are often unique items and may play an important role in the plot.

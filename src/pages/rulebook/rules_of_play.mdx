Karst is played as a shared dialog between the players and the narrator. These rules provide a framework for how that dialog is conducted and how situations with multiple outcomes can be resolved using creativity, character statistics, and chance.

# Scenes and Actions

The game is mostly comprised of Scenes.

The narrator starts a scene by describing the situation to the players. Next, the players ask the narrator any questions they might have about the scene or state any actions their characters are taking. The narrator answers questions and describes the outcomes of character actions, noting how the Scene has changed as a result.

This dialog continues back and forth until the scene reaches a conclusion, transitioning to another scene or ending the current Episode of the story.

## Actions

If a player wants their character to do something, they say so. This is called an Action. When a player declares an action, it generally happens. The narrator describes the result or invites the player to do so.

Sometimes, the narrator will determine that the character has failed or is unable to perform the action and will instead describe the result of the failure.

### Rolling for Success

When there is doubt about whether or not a character would succeed at an action, or in situations where either success or failure would be an interesting outcome, the narrator may have the player roll to determine how their character fares.

The player rolls 1d6. If the roll is a 6, the character succeeds at their action. If the roll is a 1, the character fails. For any other result, the player applies any relevant modifiers, succeeding if the modified result is 6 or higher.

Actions are sometimes modified by attributes. Many knacks, abilities, and Items can also modify action rolls, tipping the scale for or against a character.

When the outcome of an action would not be immediately apparent to the character, the narrator may roll in secret, revealing the result when it is appropriate.

The last note about rolling for success is that it should happen infrequently. Players are meant to be rewarded for their creativity, characters are capable of more than just the things on their sheets, and rolls shouldn't be made just for the sake of rolling dice. Limiting action rolls to the big moments in a game can also make them really memorable. That said, it is your game, and if you like rolling dice for every action, go for it.

## Reaction Rolls

When actions and other events might cause Bad Things to happen to a character, they will sometimes have the chance to minimize or avoid the effects by making a reaction roll. These rolls are broken up into categories but are otherwise handled the same way as action rolls.

The four categories of reaction rolls and their modifiers are:

- Poison/Death - Constitution
- Petrify/Paralysis - Charisma
- Elements - Dexterity
- Magic - Wisdom

# Encounters and Combat

Scenes are generally a free-flowing discussion, but if a confrontation between two or more groups arises, the scene becomes an Encounter.

Encounters occur over a number of Rounds. During a round, each character is given a Turn to act. In the game world, a round usually represents a handful seconds, but their length can be varied to fit the pacing of the encounter.

## Surprise

If there is a chance either side could be Surprised about the encounter, each player make a surprise roll, rolling a d6 before the first round. On a roll of a 1 or 2 the character is surprised and cannot act in the first round.

## Initiative

Characters who are not surprised roll a d6 modified by dexterity to generate their Initiative score. Participants take their turns in order of initiative from highest score to lowest, with PCs winning ties against NPCs and resolving ties amongst themselves.

## Character Turns

On their turn a character may Move and take an action. Certain actions may require the character to remain stationary or may be Sustained across multiple turns.

There are two special types of actions that characters often perform during encounters, Talking with the other side and Attacking them. These are covered in more detail below.

### Movement and Distance

Movement and distance during encounters and combat is left somewhat vague and abstract, but some assumptions can be made. For example, characters who are wearing armor or are equipped with lots of gear move slower than those who are unencumbered. Similarly, a longbow has a greater range than a short bow and a short bow, in turn, has a greater range than a sling, a dart, or a thrown dagger.

In addition to slower movement, characters who are overly encumbered may receive penalties to their defense and dexterity modifiers. Attacks made at extreme ranges may also receive a penalty. All of this is up to the judgement of the narrator.

If you find that more structure is needed, distance and movement may be broken down into conceptual ranges and measurements such as close, near, and far away, or fast, moderate, and slow.

### Talking

Characters may spend their action attempting to talk and perhaps reason, bargain, or parlay with the other side. The first time a player character does this as an action during an encounter, they get to make an action roll modified by charisma. A success or high roll may result in a less negative reaction.

### Attacking and Combat

When talking won‚Äôt do, characters can attack. If a character uses an action to make an attack during an encounter, the encounter becomes a Combat.

Attacks are made by rolling a d20 modified by strength for melee or dexterity for ranged attacks. Other modifiers may apply, such as +2 for sneak attacks made on unsuspecting targets.

If the roll is equal to or over the opponent‚Äôs defense, the character hits and does Damage.

#### Damage

A successful attack does at least 1 damage to an opponent's hit points. The attacker rolls their weapon's damage. Melee attack damage is modified by strength.

If the damage reduces a character‚Äôs hit points to zero or fewer they are knocked unconscious and are at risk of dying. Keep track of negative hit points, as they are important.

## End of Round

After all characters have had their turn, the narrator determines what happens next.

### Morale Checks

If a group of non-player characters has taken their first casualty or lost half of their members, they need to make a morale check. This is done by rolling 2d6 and comparing it against their morale score. A failed morale check results in the group surrendering or fleeing.

Morale checks do not generally apply to player characters but do apply to any companions or hirelings they might have.

### Ending an Encounter

If one side has been defeated, decided to flee, or tensions have otherwise been de-escalated, the encounter has ended. Otherwise, another round begins, starting with all characters rolling for initiative.

# Injury, Death, and Healing

## Death and Dying
Characters that have lost all of their hit points are in serious trouble. For starters, they are knocked unconscious for the remainder of the encounter. Even worse, they have a good chance of dying, especially if they are left unattended.

Immediately after being reduced to zero or fewer hit points, a character must make a death check by rolling a d6 modified by any negative hit points and constitution.

On a natural or modified roll of 1 or less, the character has died. On the natural or modified roll of 6 or greater, the character has stabilized and is no longer at immediate risk of death. On any other roll, the character remains at Death‚Äôs Door and must make another death check on their next turn.

##First Aid
Another character may spend an action to attempt to stabilize a character that has lost all of their hit points. This roll is modified by intelligence and can be improved with a first aid kit.

On a natural or modified roll of 6 or greater, the character is stabilized. On a natural or modified roll of 1 or less, the character loses another hit point.

## Recuperation
A character who has lost all of their hit points but has been stabilized must recuperate before adventuring again.

After being carried back to safety and shelter, they must spend a full week in bed recuperating. For each negative hit point a character reached before being stabilized, they must spend an additional week recuperating.

Once fully recuperated, a character is restored to 6 hit points modified by constitution and must recover any additional hit points.

## Recovery
Characters who have lost some hit points must heal or recover to regain them.

Sitting down for an hour and eating a meal will restore 1d4 hit points and can be done twice a day.

Sleeping for a full night will restore the most hit points, granting 1d6 hit modified by constitution.

# Learning Lessons

As characters complete adventures and create stories, they learn lessons. These lessons are tracked as experience. Experience is gained when characters discover loot, overcome foes, solve puzzles, and resolve situations.

For every coin of treasure and loot discovered, the characters gain one XP to divvy up amongst themselves. Sometime this experience is not gained until the loot has been fully recovered or sold off.

Experience is also rewarded for every monster and opposing NPC that the players defeat or otherwise overcome, be it through combat, avoidance, trickery, or negotiation.

Puzzles, traps, and social problems may also reward the players with experience.

Finally, narrators are encouraged to reward players with experience for exceptional acts of cleverness, daring, and storytelling.

Experience is typically rewarded at the end of the adventure, as it is simpler to calculate once at the end, rather than all throughout the course of the game and because post-adventure downtime is a good time for characters to advance if they have gained enough experience to gain a new level.

Upon gaining a new level, a character develops new knacks, gaining three knacks at every odd numbered levels and two at every even numbered level.

These rules are mostly about player characters (PCs), but also cover the non-player characters (NPCs) and monsters controlled by the narrator.

## Species & Monsters

Karst is a world with multiple sentient species, or folk, each with their own traits, cultures, and abilities. All player characters belong to one of these species, as do many NPCs.

Monster is a catch-all term for any NPC that is not one of the folk.

## Attributes

Characters have six attributes:

- Strength - physical might
- Dexterity - coordination and reaction time
- Constitution - endurance and heath
- Intelligence - mental intuition
- Wisdom - perception and judgement
- Charisma - affability and authority

Each of a character’s attributes ranges in value from 3 to 18, representing the full range of ability from inept to gifted.

An attribute’s value corresponds to a modifier that ranges from -3 to +3:

- **3:** -3
- **4, 5:** -2
- **6, 7, 8:** -1
- **9, 10, 11, 12:** 0
- **13, 14, 15:** +1
- **16, 17:** +2
- **18:** +3

These modifiers affect rolls and scores related to the attribute, reflecting the strengths and weaknesses of each character.

## Levels and Experience Points

All player characters have a level, which denotes how experienced they are. Most common folk do not have a level, but important NPCs often do.

Player characters track experience using experience points (XP), which are gained from overcoming foes, spending coins, or recovering treasure and other loot. When a character gains enough experience to reach a new level they do so as soon as is appropriate to the story.

**Level Requirements:**

1. 0 XP
2. 2000 XP
3. 4000 XP
4. 8000 XP
5. 16000 XP
6. 32000 XP
7. 64000 XP
8. 120000 XP
9. 240000 XP
10. 360000 XP

The higher the level of a character, the more extraordinary things they are capable of doing. These extraordinary things are called knacks.

## Hit Points

All characters have one or more hit points (HP), which represent a combination of luck, mental determination, and physical health. A character who loses all of their hit points is knocked unconscious and is at risk of dying.

Food and rest can restore hit points back to their original value, but never above it. Certain forms of magic are also capable of restoring hit points, sometimes even beyond natural limits.

## Defense

Defense represents how difficult it is to hit a character. It is a combination of their ability to dodge and the protection granted by the armor they are wearing.

Everyone starts with 10 defense, modified by dexterity.

Armor and shields increase defense but can slow a character down or give them negative attack modifiers, especially without the proper knack. For example, a shield improves a character’s defense by 1 but gives them a -2 to-hit attack modifier without the corresponding knack.

## Knacks

Knacks are what make characters special.

Everyone has a knack for something, even those without a level.

As characters gain levels, they develop the knack for more things, gaining three knacks at every odd numbered level and two at every even numbered level.

Knacks are the only form of character advancement.

Want to pick locks, cast more spells, have more hit points, or get better at striking your opponents? Develop the knack for it.

## Items

Characters wear armor, wield weapons, and use equipment and gear in their adventures to find treasure and other loot. All of these things are items.

Characters can carry as many items as they have points of strength. Carrying more than this results in being encumbered. Some items may be bundled together as one, such as a week of rations, 20 arrows, or 1000 coins.

Backpacks and pouches do not count against the item limit, but increase it instead. A backpack can carry 6 items while a pouch can carry 2. Characters may wear a single backpack and up to two pouches.

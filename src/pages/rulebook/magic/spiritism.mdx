Spiritism includes the arts of abjuration, divination, and necromancy. These powers are given by the Spirits Below and are primarily defensive, restorative, and illuminating.

## Level 1

### Lacerate

The Spiritist touches a character and causes 1d6+1 damage. In combat, a successful attack roll must be made before this spell can be cast.

### Heal

With a touch, the Spiritist restores up to 1d6+1 HP to a single character or themselves. Alternatively, this spell may be used to cure paralysis.

### Detect Evil

For the next hour, the Spiritist can detect ill-will and evil intentions in nearby characters and magical objects.

### Detect Magic

The Spiritist observes a telltale aura around any character or object under the effects of magic for the next 20 minutes.

### Protective Aura

The Spiritist is encircled by a protective aura for the next two hours. Those who oppose the Spiritist in hatred or anger suffer a -1 attack modifier. In addition, the caster gains a +1 modifier when making reaction rolls against any spell or affect from said opponents.

### Decipher

For 20 minutes, the Spiritist may read, but not speak, any unknown language, code, or diagram.

The arts of illusion and charm comprise the form of Deceit and all its splendor.

Practitioners of this somewhat sinister form are capable of twisting others thought, feelings, and perceptions of the world around them. Though some use the power of Deceit for good, it is no small wonder that the practice is frowned upon by many.

## Level 1

### Charm Person

The practitioner targets any one folk whose face they can clearly see and convinces them that they are fast friends. Assuming they can communicate, the caster may then command the target, within reason.

The target may make an immediate reaction roll to resist the effect. If this roll fails, the target may attempt to roll again once every week until the effect is broken. Characters of above average wisdom may attempt to save daily, while those with below average wisdom may only save monthly.

### Cause Fear

The practitioner instills a single character they can see with an overwhelming sense of fear, causing them to flee and cower for 20 minutes. The target may make a reaction roll to resist the the effect.

### Remove Fear

With a touch, the practitioner may remove any natural fear from a single character for 20 minutes. If the target of this spell is suffering from magical fear, they may make a reaction roll to resist it with the casterâ€™s charisma modifier as a bonus.

### Sleep

The practitioner targets a nearby group of living characters causing 2d8 hit dice worth of them to fall asleep for 4d4 x 10 minutes.

### Ventriloquism

With this spell, the practitioner is able to make the sound of their voice come from anywhere within earshot of a loud whisper.

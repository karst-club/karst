A devout form, Theurgy is expressed through the dual arts of Evocation and Conjuration. The Theurge channels the intent of the Gods Above, manifesting their Will within the world. An often direct form, Theurgy shines in battle.

## Level 1

### Floating Disc

The Theurge summons an invisible platform that closely follows the caster at waist height for 2d6 x 10 minutes. The platform is roughly the size of a shield and can hold up to 6 items.

### Magic Missile

The Theurge channels the Will of the Gods into a bolt of pure energy, striking a visible target for 1d6+1 points damage. For every 5 spell slot the caster has, they gain an additional two missiles which may be used to strike the same or different targets.

### Shield

The Theurge shields themselves with the Will of the Gods. For 20 minutes, the caster's defense becomes 15 against melee attacks and 17 versus missiles.

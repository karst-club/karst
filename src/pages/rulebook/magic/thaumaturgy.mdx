The Form of Thaumaturgy encompasses a singular art, Alteration.

Possessing the largest and possibly most diverse group of spells, practitioners of this powerful art are able to physically change the world around them.

## Level 1

### Darkness

The Thaumaturge creates a 30 foot sphere of near-perfect darkness, blocking all sight except for infravision and cancelling out a Light spell if cast against it. If instead cast on a target's eyes, it causes blindness unless they succeed at a reaction roll against it. The Darkness may be canceled at will but otherwise lasts for an hour plus 10 minutes for each spell slot that the caster has.

### Jam

This spell allows the Thaumaturge to magically hold shut a door, gate, or any other portal for 2d6 x 10 minutes. This hold may be broken by a monster with 3 or more hit dice than the caster or a character whose strength is 3 higher than the caster's intelligence.

### Light

A 30 foot sphere of light is created by this spell that may be canceled at will but otherwise lasts for an hour plus 10 minutes for every spell slot the caster has. The center point may be cast on an object. If cast on a character's eyes, they become blinded unless they save.

### Purify Food and Water

The Thaumaturge is able to purify spoiled food and dirty water, allowing it to be consumed. When cast, this spell purifies one ration of food, 6 skins of water or enough unpreserved food to feed a dozen for each spell slot the character has.

### Inner Warmth

The Thaumaturge, or one character within 60' of the caster is made resistant to cold temperatures for an hour. Freezing temperatures have no effect on the target, they gain +2 to reaction rolls against cold effect, and cold damage is reduced by -1 per die.

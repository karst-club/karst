Rising up from the otherwise unbroken stillness of the Mirror Sea, the islands of the Karst Archipelago stand alone between the vast expanses of the sea and the Impossibly Blue Sky.

It is said that long ago that the three distant shores were one and there was no Mirror Sea, but in time, they grew apart and so the sea was born. Whence came the archipelago, left behind or arisen since, matters little to most inhabitants. What does however, is that the three distant shores – the ancestral homelands of the archipelago’s folk – have seemingly vanished.

No boats have arrived from the Eastern Woods, the Western Sands, or the Southern Swamps in a generation, and few still cling to the hope that they ever will again. Already an independent lot, the folk of the archipelago have taken this isolation mostly in stride.

Colonial outposts have become island states and loose alliances of fishing villages have transformed into merchant kingdoms, but for each community that has flourished, an equal number have perished – or worse. Pirate dens have grown into cutthroat hives, while scores of villages and islands have fallen silent – abandoned or overrun.

## History

The modern history of the Karst Archipelago begins hundreds of years ago, when religious Lagartos separatists left the Southern Swamps on primitive ships rather than joining budding society created by their fellow folk and the Visita in the newly formed floating cities. These separatists reached the southernmost islands of the archipelago and soon formed small communities centered around the worship of the Spirits Below.

Almost immediately, the lagartos discovered that the islands were home to many strange and powerful spirits.

## Life in the Archipelago

Isolated from the rest of the world, life goes on for most folk in the Karst Archipelago. Those who live in the villages, towns, and cities of the nation states and island kingdoms lead fairly mundane lives. The warm climate and the abundance of the sea provide for the most basic of needs and many islands have some form of agriculture: orchards, vineyards, root crops, and similar.

## Places

Much of the archipelago remains unexplored or recently forgotten, while other islands that are known far and wide. The following nation states, ports of call, and merchant kingdoms are some of the most recognized places in the Karst Archipelago.

### Belagoria

A prosperous merchant kingdom, Belagoria sits on the precipice of multiple disasters. Ever at odds with its rival, Golandra, hostilities between the two nations have begun to spiral into open warfare. At home, the peasants are finally revolting against the wealthy excesses of the ruling merchant families as a blight in Eastern Belagoria enters its third year. And lastly, a major earthquake is about to strike.

### Eektorp Bay

One of the busiest – and dirtiest – ports of call in the archipelago, Eektorp Bay is a maze of shipyards, docks, high roads, and back alleys – all choked with corruption and filth. It’s ruler, the Duke, is a corpulent autocrat with an insatiable hunger for goose and honied dontlers. He rules the Bay and the nearby slums of Hoveltun with a lazy – but iron – fist, going months without oppressing the citizenry only to crack down on a whim, executing a handful of folk for some minor or completely arbitrary slight, real or perceived.

### Porta Cortu

The biggest little city in Karst, Porta Cortu is an eclectic collection of communities crammed onto three small islands. From trade guilds, merchants, and farmers to high streets, retired ship captains, and a university of thaumaturgy and history – not to mention a whole island of iconoclasts – the islands are broken up into loosely organized districts, each claiming some amount of authority, all nominally ruled by the Trifecta, a mostly-powerless council of district representatives.

### Thark

A meritocratic kingdom known for its mighty warriors, Thark is a proud and insecure culture. Citizens of Thark praise honesty and forthright behavior; Deceit is shunned. The nation is comprised mainly of two large and hilly islands. The larger of the two, Thark Minora, being the largest in the archipelago.

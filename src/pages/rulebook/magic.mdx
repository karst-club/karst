The Karst Archipelago is steeped in magic. From subtle illusions to overt evocations, the use of magic is not uncommon, though neither is it an everyday occurrence in the lives of most folk. There are four types, or traditions, of magic, each with its own connection to the cosmology of the world.

When the Gods Above died in the creation of the world, their will became a part of all things. To channel and manifest this will is known as Theurgy – a demanding path, whose faithful reward is the most direct and forceful type of magic.

The reflections of those folk who came before are known as the Spirits Below. Practitioners of Spiritism seek their aid… or do their bidding. The spirits guide those who beseech them, soothing wounds and helping light the way. But their gifts, too, are sought by those with more vengeful desires.

Though it whispers into every ear, none dare speak openly of Deceit. Few would willfully listen to its treacherous words, but those who do quickly become versed in its tongue. No magic is as sinister as that of Deceit, for it has the power to shape perceptions, thoughts, and even the emotions of others.

All that is everything has been woven together in the Essence of Existence; Thaumaturgy is the noble art and science of its transformation. To understand the essence of existence and reshape it to one’s own desires is the life work of every Thaumaturge – a study that is equal parts research and applied practice.

## Practicing Magic

A Practitioner of magic is any character who has been versed in one or more of the magical traditions. Strictly speaking, this means that they have developed at least one level of any of the magical knacks: Deceit, Spiritism, Thaumaturgy, and Theurgy – granting them the knowledge of spellcasting.

Practically speaking, there is little that can be done with this knowledge unless a characters has also developed at least one level of the Memorization knack, which is used to memorize and cast the spells that they have learned. There are a number of other knacks whose gifts are magical in nature, but developing them, or the memorization knack alone, does not make a character a magical practitioner.

## Spell Memorization

Magical spells can be memorized and cast by practitioners. Though each type of magic has its own source and mysteries, all four follow the same casting rules and are counted together for the purpose of memorization.

Once per day, a practitioner may spend a few minutes memorizing any spells that they have learned how to cast. A character may memorize one spell for each level of the memorization knack that they have developed. Any spell that was previously memorized but not cast is wiped from memory at this time, but can still be re-memorized. A character may memorize any spell they know, with one condition: for each spell memorized that is higher than the first level, an equal or greater number of spells must also be memorized for each level below the spell’s level. There is no restriction against memorizing the same spell multiple times.

## Spell Casting

As an action, a practitioner may cast any spell that they have memorized. Once cast, a spell’s effect occurs and it is wiped from the practitioner’s memory. Most spell effects are instantaneous and permanent, though others may grow with time or fade after a short while – each spell is unique.

Unique too, is the method by which each practitioner casts their magic, be it through gestures, words, or simple thought. In all cases, the act of casting takes only an instant, but requires much concentration and focus. If a character is restrained, has already been damaged in the current round of an altercation, or similar, it is assumed that they are harried and unable to concentrate enough to cast a spell.

Certain magical items and knacks grant characters the ability to use spell-like powers. Using them in this manner is typically an action, much like spellcasting, but with rules specific to the item or ability in question. Often, the effect of these powers are analogous to those of a specific spell, and will be describes as being so.

# Deceit

> “Whispers and Lies.”

The Lies of Deceit are impressive, but ultimately hollow, spells. They are the weakest magic, unable to affect the physical plane and the Essence of Existence. Yet, they are also the strongest magic, for they can deceive the perceptions of others, clouding their judgement and bending their very thoughts and will.

Unlike other spells, the target of a lie is always given a chance to see through it, though this chance becomes more and more minuscule the greater the lie. Wise characters are particularly good at seeing through lies, and add one to any roll to resist a the effects of one. Some lies affect more than one target. If a character sees through the lie, the spell is broken for them but remains in place for the others.

## Level One - Deception

### Charm

A friendly smile and honied words.

_Target one nearby character. They must make an action roll to resist, or they will be charmed, serving serving you with the loyalty typically reserved for a good friend.

A character who has reason to suspect the illusion may make an action roll to see through it._

### Paralize

The mind is its own prison.

_ Target between one and three nearby characters. They must make an action roll to resist or they are unable to move for the next one to three minutes. _

The illusion comes to life.

_You may create an illusion in the form of any living being that you have encountered before. This illusion may attack other characters and has the same statistics as what it represents. However, the wounds it causes are illusory, though they may render a character unconscious. If a phantasm is struck even once, it will dissolve._

### Dreamscape

A big lie.

_This lie functions in the same manner as hallucinations, but can effect a much larger area, up to the size of a small field._

### Truth

A reason for the lies after all.

_You may remove the veil of lies from the eyes of another, allowing them to see the truth of existence. What particular effect this will have varies from individual to individual, but the end result is the same: permanent insanity._

# Spiritism

> “The spirits guide.”

Through Guidance the Spirits Below interact with the living. This guidance takes on countless forms – as many forms as there are spirits to guide. Each practitioner’s relationship with the spirits differs, too. Some seek their aid, others seek to serve them. The true nature and goals of the spirits are known by few, but they are respected, if not revered, by most folk.

All guidance is of a dual nature: able to help or harm. When a Spiritist memorizes a spell, they do not choose which form to memorize, but instead decide at the moment of casting.

## Level One - Empathy

### Decipher

Every tongue was once spoken.

_For the next hour, the caster or one target is able to read text in any language as well as any ciphers, as long as the author is dead.

Alternatively, one target is unable to read or understand anything spoken to them for the next hour, as the chatter of spirits fills their mind._

### Sense Essence

The view from Below.

_For the next hour, the caster is able to detect the presence of any nearby magical effects or powers.

### Transference

### Pathway

The spirits guide and the spirits hide.

_You are able to sense the general direction of your current goal for the next hour. The more specific and detailed your knowledge of your goal, the more detailed and specific the guidance will be. Alternatively, you may cast this spell to conceal an object. For the next hour it will go unnoticed, unless if someone is explicitly looking for it, in which case they must make an action roll to do so._

Some endings are premature.

_You may revive one character who has failed a death check within the past day, restoring them to full health after a few hours of rest._

# Thaumaturgy

> “The gift of the Wind.”

The Thaumaturge studies the Essence of Existence, seeking to understand its ways and shape it to their desire. The great works of Thaumaturgy are known as Transformations. These precise and exacting spells change the Essence of Existence, often pushing it to one extreme or another. More direct than the subversive forms of magic, there is still a sublime grace to art and science of Thaumaturgy.

While it is claimed that Thaumaturgy was taught to folk by the Wind itself, the modern teaching and practice is more regimented than other forms of magic. Many Thaumaturges have undergone a formal course of study at a school or university or began their career as an apprentice. As a result, there are many competing schools of thought, academic rivalries, and theoretical disputes amongst the thaumaturgical community.

## Level One - The Apprentice

### Lumination

Light and shadow.

_Target one character, item, or piece of scenery, making it glow brightly or absorb nearby light, illuminating the area nearby or casting it into complete darkness. This effect lasts for one hour. If cast on the eyes of a character, they are blinded for the spell’s duration._

### Levitation

Up and down.

### Speak with Animals

Squeak and squawk.

_For the next hour you may speak with any member of the animal kingdom. This ability in and of itself does not automatically make animals any more sympathetic, but most may be reasoned with, to a degree._

Hot and cold.

_Choose one nearby target, it is unaffected by changes in temperature for the next hour._

## Level Three - The Adept

The language of the leaves.

### Growth

More from less.

_Target yourself, another nearby character, or item. The target instantly doubles in size and remains so for the next hour. Successful attacks by large characters do twice as much damage._

### Transmute

Everything is everything.

_Target yourself, another nearby character, or an item. The target instantly transforms into another character or item of your choosing and remains so for the next hour._

# Theurgy

> “The Will of the Gods.”

Faithful is the path of the Theurge – for devotion is the price that must be paid in exchange for the Miracles they work. The Gods Above are dead, but their Will is very much alive and present in all things. It is harmony that the Theurge seeks through devotion. To live in accordance with the will of their chosen gods – and rid the world of the inharmonious – is their purpose and goal.

The miracles performed by the Theurge are not subtle matters. These powers often affect change in the most violent or direct manner possible.

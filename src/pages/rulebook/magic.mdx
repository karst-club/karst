The Karst Archipelago is steeped in magic. From subtle illusions to overt evocations, the use of magic is not uncommon, though neither is it an everyday occurrence in the lives of most folk. There are four types, or traditions, of magic, each with its own connection to the cosmology of the world.

When the Gods Above died in the creation of the world, their will became a part of all things. To channel and manifest this will is known as Theurgy – a demanding path, whose faithful reward is the most direct and forceful type of magic.

The reflections of those folk who came before are known as the Spirits Below. Practitioners of Spiritism seek their aid… or do their bidding. The spirits guide those who beseech them, soothing wounds and helping light the way. But their gifts, too, are sought by those with more vengeful desires.

Though it whispers into every ear, none dare speak openly of Deceit. Few would willfully listen to its treacherous words, but those who do quickly become versed in its tongue. No magic is as sinister as that of Deceit, for it has the power to shape perceptions, thoughts, and even the emotions of others.

All that is everything has been woven together in the Essence of Existence; Thaumaturgy is the noble art and science of its transformation. To understand the essence of existence and reshape it to one’s own desires is the life work of every Thaumaturge – a study that is equal parts research and applied practice.

## Practicing Magic

A Practitioner of magic is any character who has been versed in one or more of the magical traditions. Strictly speaking, this means that they have developed at least one level of any of the magical knacks: Deceit, Spiritism, Thaumaturgy, and Theurgy – granting them the knowledge of spellcasting.

Practically speaking, there is little that can be done with this knowledge unless a characters has also developed at least one level of the Memorization knack, which is used to memorize and cast the spells that they have learned. There are a number of other knacks whose gifts are magical in nature, but developing them, or the memorization knack alone, does not make a character a magical practitioner.

## Spell Memorization

Magical spells can be memorized and cast by practitioners. Though each type of magic has its own source and mysteries, all four follow the same casting rules and are counted together for the purpose of memorization.

Once per day, a practitioner may spend a few minutes memorizing any spells that they have learned how to cast. A character may memorize one spell for each level of the memorization knack that they have developed. Any spell that was previously memorized but not cast is wiped from memory at this time, but can still be re-memorized. A character may memorize any spell they know, with one condition: for each spell memorized that is higher than the first level, an equal or greater number of spells must also be memorized for each level below the spell’s level. There is no restriction against memorizing the same spell multiple times.

## Spell Casting

As an action, a practitioner may cast any spell that they have memorized. Once cast, a spell’s effect occurs and it is wiped from the practitioner’s memory. Most spell effects are instantaneous and permanent, though others may grow with time or fade after a short while – each spell is unique.

Unique too, is the method by which each practitioner casts their magic, be it through gestures, words, or simple thought. In all cases, the act of casting takes only an instant, but requires much concentration and focus. If a character is restrained, has already been damaged in the current round of an altercation, or similar, it is assumed that they are harried and unable to concentrate enough to cast a spell.

Certain magical items and knacks grant characters the ability to use spell-like powers. Using them in this manner is typically an action, much like spellcasting, but with rules specific to the item or ability in question. Often, the effect of these powers are analogous to those of a specific spell, and will be describes as being so.

# Deceit

The Lies of Deceit are impressive, but ultimately hollow, spells. They are the weakest magic, unable to affect the physical plane and the Essence of Existence. Yet, they are also the strongest magic, for they can deceive the perceptions of others, clouding their judgement and bending their very thoughts and will.

Unlike other spells, the target of a lie is always given a chance to see through it, though this chance becomes more and more minuscule the greater the lie. Wise characters are particularly good at seeing through lies, and add one to any roll to resist a the effects of one. Some lies affect more than one target. If a character sees through the lie, the spell is broken for them but remains in place for the others.

![A Liar](../../images/deceit.png)

## Level One - Deception

To Deceive another is the first of many Lies.

### Charm

A friendly smile and honied words can unlock almost any door.

_Choose one character to charm. They must make an action roll to resist, or they will be charmed by the caster, serving them with loyalty reserved for a good friend. The effects of charm last for one day. If charm is cast on the same target every day for a week, the effects will last for a month._

### Fear

There is no feeling more primal… or easier to invoke.

_Choose one target. They must make an action roll to resist, or they will become terrified, running away or cowering in abject fear for the next half hour._

### Sleep

Some fear that dreams are but visions of Deceit. How right they are.

_Choose one target. They must make an action roll to resist or they will fall asleep for at least one hour and more if they are tired._

## Level Two - Illusion

The Liar is next taught illusion, learning how flimsy the senses truly are.

### Hold

Perceived or real, it is enough to convince another of their own limits.

_TODO: Effect._

### Vanish

A lie of omission.

_You become invisible to other folk and creatures for one hour. Attacking or touching another character causes immediate detection. A character who has reason to suspect your presence may make an action roll to detect you._

### Hallucinations

The sense are easily fooled.

_You may create an illusion that lasts for one hour. This may include sights, sounds, smells, touch, and even taste, encompassing an area as large as a room. Everything within the illusion must be inanimate, though running water, fire, contraptions and other things that move without life are perfectly acceptable. A character who has reason to suspect the illusion may make an action roll to see through it._

# Spiritism

Through Guidance the Spirits Below aid their descendants in the world of the living. All guidance is of a dual nature, able to help or harm. When a Spiritist memorizes spells, they do not choose which nature, but decide instead in the moment of casting.

![A Spiritist](../../images/spiritism.png)

## Level One - Empathy

To feel, to understand, to have empathy is to hear the Spirits’ Guidance.

### Decipher

Every dead tongue was once spoken.

_For the next hour, the caster or one target is able to read text in any language as well as any ciphers, as long as the author is dead. The caster adds two to any roll to understand ciphers whose author is still alive. Alternatively, one target is unable to read or understand anything spoken to them for the next hour, as the chatter of spirits fills their mind._

### Sense Essence

The gift of perspective.

_For the next hour, the caster is able to detect the presence of any nearby magical effects or powers. Lies and other means of Deceit are not automatically detected, but the caster adds two to any rolls to see through them. Alternatively, the caster may conceal the magical nature of any one character, item, or effect, hiding its nature for the next hour._

### Heal / Harm

A gift to buoy the living – or a curse to strike them down.

_The caster or one target they touch immediately gains or loses six health. If this brings a character from zero or less health to a positive value, they immediately recover from unconsciousness and can adventure as normal after a short rest._

## Level Two - Purpose

With a newfound sense of Purpose, the Spiritist embraces the Spirits’ Guidance.

### Show Path

The spirits guide the way.

_TODO: Effect._

### Know Intention

True intent is hard to hide from the eyes of the past.

_The Spirits reveal the intentions of others to the caster. For the next hour…_

### Share Thoughts

TODO: Mental radio. Replace?

_TODO: Effect._

# Thaumaturgy

The great works of Thaumaturgy are known as Transformations. These precise and exacting spells manipulate the state of the Essence of Existence, often pushing it to one extreme or another.

![A Thaumaturge](../../images/thaumaturgy.png)

## Level One - The Apprentice

TODO: Description.

### Light & Shroud

For every light there is a shadow.

_Target one character, item, or piece of scenery, making it glow brightly or absorb nearby light, illuminating the area nearby or casting it into complete darkness. This effect lasts for one hour. If cast on the eyes of a character, they are blinded for the spell’s duration._

### Stick & Repel

The forces of attraction and repulsion are two sides to one coin.

%%The budding Apprentice learns quickly how to fuse two objects together or force them apart, if only for a short while.

_TODO: Effect._

### Purify & Spoil

In time, all things rot – but in time, all things were once unspoiled.

%%Time itself is but another part of existence to change. Practicing at first with small portions of food, the Apprentice begins to understand time’s ebb and flow.

_You may age or reverse the aging of up to a dozen meals’ worth of food, making it edible or inedible in the process._

## Level Two - The Student

TODO: Description.

### Resist Heat or Cold

TODO: Description.

_TODO: Effect._

### Levitation

Straight up and down only, basically anti-gravity.

_TODO: Effect._

### Speak with Animals

TODO: Description.

_TODO: Effect._

# Theurgy

Faithful is the path of the Theurge – for the Miracles they work come from the very will of the Gods Above and devotion is the price that must be paid in exchange. Yes, the Gods are dead, but their will is very much alive and present in all things. It is a harmony that the Theurgy hopes to find through their devotion. To live in accordance with the will of their chosen gods – and rid the world of the inharmonious – is their purpose and goal.

The miracles performed by the Theurge are not subtle matters. These powers involve setting things right and often in the most violent or direct manner (with the notion of “right” – in this case – being a highly subjective one, at that).

![A Theurge](../../images/theurgy.png)

## Level One - Observance

Basic observance must be mastered before the Theurge moves on to greater miracles.

### Bolt

A bolt of energy to strike down the opposed.

_Strike one visible target for six damage._

### Shield

Will alone can withstand all troubles.

_Chose one visible target or yourself to gain four defense for one hour._

## Level Two - Reverence

### Bless

TODO: Description.

_TODO: Effect. Add two? To attacks?_

### Blight

TODO: Description.

_TODO: Effect._

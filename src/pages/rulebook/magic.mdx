The Karst Archipelago is steeped in magic. From subtle illusions to overt evocations, the use of magic is not uncommon, though neither is it an everyday occurrence in the lives of most folk. There are four types, or traditions, of magic, each with its own connection to the cosmology of the world.

When the Gods Above died in the creation of the world, their will became a part of all things. To channel and manifest this will is known as Theurgy– a demanding path, whose faithful reward is the most direct and forceful type of magic.

The reflections of those folk who came before are known as the Spirits Below. To seek their aid or do their bidding is to be a practitioner of Spiritism. The spirits guide those who beseech them, soothing wounds and helping light the way. But their gifts are sought, too, by those with more vengeful desires.

Though it whispers into every ear, none dare speak openly of Deceit. Few would willfully listen to its treacherous words, but those who do quickly become versed in its tongue. No magic is as sinister as that of Deceit, for it has the power to shape perceptions, thoughts, and even the emotions of others.

All that is everything has been woven together in the Essence of Existence; Thaumaturgy is the noble art and science of its transformation. To understand the essence of existence and reshape it to one’s own desires is the life work of every Thaumaturge– a study that is equal parts research and applied practice.

## Practicing Magic

A Practitioner of magic is any character who has been steeped in one or more of the magical traditions. Strictly speaking, this means that they have developed at least one level of any of the magical knacks: Deceit, Spiritism, Thaumaturgy, and Theurgy– which grants them the knowledge of spellcasting.

Practically speaking, there is little that can be done with this knowledge unless a characters has also developed the Memorization knack, which is used to memorize and cast the spells that they have learned. There are a number of other knacks whose gifts are magical in nature, but developing them, or the memorization knack alone, does not make a character a magical practitioner.

## Spell Memorization

Magical spells can be memorized and cast by practitioners. Though each type of magic has its own source and mysteries, all four follow the same casting rules and are counted together for the purpose of memorization.

Once per day, a practitioner may spend a few minutes memorizing any spells that they have learned how to cast. A character may memorize one spell for each level of the memorization knack that they have developed. Any spell that was previously memorized but not cast is wiped from memory at this time but can still be re-memorized. A character may memorize any spell they know, with one condition. For each spell memorized that is higher than the first level, an equal or greater number of spells must also be memorized for each level below the spell’s level. There is no restriction against memorizing the same spell multiple times.

## Spell Casting

As an action, a practitioner may cast any spell that they have memorized. Once cast, a spell’s effect occurs and it is wiped from the practitioner’s memory. Most spell effects are instantaneous and permanent, though others may grow with time or fade after a short while– each spell is unique.

Unique too, is the method by which each practitioner casts their magic, be it through gestures, words, or simple thought. In all cases, the act of casting takes only an instant, but requires much concentration and focus. If a character is restrained, has already been damaged in the current round of an altercation, or similar, it is assumed that they are too harried to cast a spell.

%% TODO Resistance

Certain magical items and knacks grant characters the ability to use spell-like powers. Using them in this manner is typically an action, much like spellcasting but with rules specific to the item or ability in question. Often, the effect of these powers are analogous to those of a specific spell, and will be describes as being so.

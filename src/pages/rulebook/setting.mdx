The game takes place in the Karst Archipelago, a collection of islands in the Mirror Sea. The Archipelago was once situated between three continents, the Eastern Woods, the Western Sands, and the Southern Swamps but it has been a generation since boats have arrived or returned from those now-distant shores.

# Cosmology

## The Gods Above

In the skies Above reside the Hollow Gods, they that have given of themselves to create Existence. It is said that their Will lives on in all things and that their original Intent may still be channeled by those with Knowledge and Faith of Theurgy.

## The Spirits Below

Our great ancestors dwell in the Far Below. Those that may speak with them possess the Oracle of Spiritism.

## The Essence of Existence

The raw material from which we are all formed. Thaumaturgy is the Art and Science of bending this Essence to one‚Äôs Will.

## The Whispers In the Wings

For every bit of belief and surety, there exists a doubt. The Whispers speak through this doubt. To Learn their Tongue is to Speak the Language of Deceit.

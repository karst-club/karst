The stories of Karst are filled with a diverse cast of characters– so the system for creating them is both simple and flexible.

_Before the game can begin, each player must create a character._ The narrator, too, may need to create characters at times; however, many of the folk in the game world need not be so fully fledged.

_The process of creating a character involves making a dozen choices from a handful of lists and then coming up with a few personal details, such as a name._ If you are particularly indecisive, in a hurry, or need to create a bunch of characters quickly, you can let the roll of the dice make most of the choices.

There are different ways of approaching character creation. These steps can be done in any order that you like, not just the order in which they are presented here. Perhaps you already have an idea in mind and know exactly how you want to proceed, but maybe you don’t know what kind of character you would like to create. In this case, you could start by looking at some of the choices in the later steps to see if anything inspires you.

If you know who you want your character to be, you might start with their name, background, and what type of folk they are. Conversely, if you know what you want them to be able to do, start with their abilities, knacks, and items.

Just note that no matter how you go through these steps, there are a few places where one choice can affect another, but you should be able to figure them out.

## Vital Statistics

_Characters begin at the first Level and start with a base of six health and ten defense– note these values down somewhere._ Each one represents an important and measurable aspect of the character.

**A character’s overall experience is represented by their level,** a number that ranges from one to ten and spans a lifetime of advancement. Health and defense are measures of a character’s well being and how difficult it is to harm them– two concepts that were covered in the previous chapter.

## Folk

Your first choice is a big one: which of the six folk will the character be? Each has their own history, culture, traits and special ability.

_Choose which folk the character is and note it down, as well as the ability it confers._ If you would like to learn more about the different folk before choosing one, turn to the next chapter.

- **Eekhorn -** Start with climb walls knack.
- **Grevling -** Ignore negative modifiers for death checks.
- **Lagartos -** Start with alertness knack.
- **Serpos -** Can see heat.
- **Veldling -** Start with sharp ears knack.
- **Visita -** Take one ability twice instead of two abilities.

## Abilities

Next, we will define the innate talents with which your character is gifted. These gifts are called Abilities and they represent something about the character beyond the mechanical bonus that they confer. As a player or narrator, it is up to you to make a character’s abilities part of the story.

- **Strong -** Add one to damage.
- **Quick -** Add one to defense.
- **Tough -** Add three to health.
- **Clever -** Take one core knack twice to start.
- **Wise -** Add one to resist Deceit.
- **Likable -** Add one to morale and similar.

_Choose two different abilities for your character and note them down._ Visita characters are the exception, instead choosing one ability to become very gifted at– gaining twice the effect.

## Knacks

Knacks are what makes each character special. Everyone is assumed to be capable of performing any kind of action, especially if it fits into their background or abilities. Knacks, however, are extraordinary things that very few folk can do.

It can a little tempting to think of them as skills, but Knacks are a bit more than that. In similar manner to abilities, each knack confers a mechanical bonus, but also represents something about who the character is and what kind of things they are capable of. A character who is Technically Minded, for example, will gain a bonus to any action roll involving mechanical contraptions, but more importantly, they shouldn’t even have to roll for most of these kinds of tasks unless they are in a hurry, under extreme pressure, or doing something incredibly complicated.

%% ^ This breaks the no examples “rule”. Is that ok? Is that rule dumb?

**Characters begin with three knacks and develop three more each time they reach another level of experience.** Many knacks may be developed more than once, as the character gains experience, but all three starting knacks must be different.

This rule does not apply to characters who are clever– they must choose one core knack twice, or even thrice, if they are very clever. This bonus counts as one of their three selections and only applies to the knacks chosen when the character is being created.

_Turn ahead to the Knacks chapter, select your character’s three starting knacks, and write them down._ If you aren’t sure of what type of character you would like to play, browsing through the list of available knacks can be a great way to learn about some of the options.

## Items

Items are the armor, weapons, and equipment that characters carry with them. Abilities and knacks represent a character’s natural and learned talents, but it is items that often allow them to use these talents to their fullest. Conversely, some items are so difficult to use that a character without the right knack will struggle to properly wield or wear them.

_Characters begin with five common items and five coins (¢5)._ You may choose to have a character begin with fewer items, in exchange for more starting coins. _A character starts with an additional ¢20 for each item selection that is not made. Turn ahead to the Items chapter to make your selections. _

## Background and Name

**The previous steps have been about what the character is capable of, but that is only half the story– you must also decide who this character is.** This is represented by a background and a name, a few words about the character’s role in the world and something to call them by.

This step is less formal than the others, as a background can be what ever you want. **There is no specific mechanical advantage to one background or another.** However, backgrounds play an outsized role in helping the players and narrator drive the story and understand character motivations. They also very much effect the actions that a character performs– **an action consistent with a character’s background is more likely to succeed than those that are not. **

...A character’s abilities, knacks, and starting items are often informed by their background, or vice versa.

_Choose a name and a background for your character. Jot them down, as well as anything else you would like to note about them._ This could be nothing more than the choices you have made, or you could write a whole novel about your character– though that might be a bit much.

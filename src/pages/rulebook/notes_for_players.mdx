Karst is a game about exploration, stories, and memories.

Everything in Karst is a book or some other kind of written record. The rules are a book and so is the Setting, even your games are books. Adventures exist as entries in diaries, characters as sketches in journals, records of loot obtained as ledgers in log books, hand-drawn maps of islands and dungeons, chapters in the story of what once was.

The Karst Archipelago is now gone and forgotten, these books are all that remain of its memories.

As a player of the game, you have two goals. The first one is pretty obvious: your role is to act out and embody one of the story’s protagonists, attempting to alter the course of the plot in accordance with their motivations.

The second goal – which is just the second rule of the game repeated for effect – is to serve the story. There will be times when the characters’ motivations are opposed, and this is good – some of the most interesting and fun stories come from casts of characters that don't always get along. What matters most, however, is that you as players are enjoying the interactions and the story. Some groups may love a lot of drama between player characters, while others might enjoy playing as a unified team. Above all else, it's about how you, as a group, want to play the game.

The follow are not rules, but ideas and suggestions that can be modified to fit your group's tastes and preferences.

## Journaling

Karst is a game about exploration, stories, and memories.

Everything in Karst is a book or some other kind of written record. Adventures exist as entries in diaries, characters as sketches in journals, records of loot obtained as ledgers in log books, hand-drawn maps of islands and dungeons, chapters in the story of what once was.

The Karst Archipelago is now gone and forgotten, these books are all that remain of its memories.

## Playing as a Party

Unless you are a solo player, playing together as a party is an important part of the game. Parties and players can operate more efficiently if they designate and delegate certain tasks. This has the additional benefits of reducing the narrator’s workload and creating more content for the game in the form of maps and journals.

Depending on the size and needs of the group, some or all of the following roles may be worth assigning to certain players or characters. It's up to you if you want the players or their characters to be the ones performing the roles and whether or not they rotate between adventures.

### Mapper

Karst is a game about exploration. Having someone map where you are going and where you have been when you are out in the wilderness, delving into dungeons, or even navigating a town can prevent you from getting lost and help you find your way back again. Besides, it can be just plain fun to have cool maps of imaginary places.

### Journalist

Karst is a game about stories and memories. Keeping a diary or log of the things that have occurred can make it a lot easier to pick up where the group left off in between sessions. It also makes for a great post-game memento. In fact, a diary can be a great way to turn a game of Karst into a short story or novella, if you want to share your story with others.

Much of the motivation that led to Karst came from the desire to have a system that lent itself to written storytelling in the form of character’s journals. Of course documenting a game takes time and it isn't for everyone. There is absolutely no requirement that you write anything down, Karst can be enjoyed without any amount of journaling whatsoever.

### Bookkeeper

Whether or not you want to journal and map your adventures, pretty much every party needs some kind of shared ledger or inventory and it helps to have an appointed bookkeeper maintain it. Unless your group instantly divvies up the loot and takes an everyone for themselves approach to things, you are going to have a few shared items, treasures, and concerns. And, if you’re really lucky, you might even have a whole ship to worry about someday…

### Lead

Not every group needs or wants a lead, but some may find them invaluable, especially larger parties. An effective lead does not control the party, but acts as their representative. They describes to the narrator what the group is doing – especially during scenes of exploration – while making sure to step back and give the other players opportunities to chime in when it’s their character's time to shine.

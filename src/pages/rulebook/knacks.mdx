Knacks
Knacks are part of what make individuals different and special.

Everyone has a knack for something, starting with a singular knack for characters without a level.

Characters develop three knacks for every odd-numbered level they reach and two knacks for every even-numbered level.

Some knacks may be developed more than once but only once per level. Certain knacks require other prerequisite knacks.

Anyone may develop Basic knacks but a character must reach level 5 to develop Expert knacks.

## The Fundamentals

### Focus

**Effect:** Your Focus grows by 1. 

**Level:** Basic

**Note:** May be taken once per level.

Many characters have one or more points of focus. These points are used to increase one's prowess during combat. At the start of each round of combat, characters may declare how they are allocating their focus. If no declaration is made, it is assumed that their allocation remains the same. In the interest of fast play, players should create a default allocation.

By default, characters may only allocate focus to increase their attack modifier, with each point allocated increasing the modifier by 1 for all rolls. Certain knacks and other abilities allow characters to allocate points into other areas, such as improving damage, defense, or initiative.

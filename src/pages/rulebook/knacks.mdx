Knacks are the central element of character development and specialization in Karst. Every character begins with three knacks and develops three more with each additional level of experience. As characters grow, they gain access to more powerful and specialized knacks.

There are four categories of knacks:

- **Core** knacks represent central talents that grow with experience and may be developed as often as once per level.
- **Odd-leveled** knacks are the magical traditions that some folk practice and the magical gifts that others possess. They may be developed up to five time, once for each odd-numbered level of experience that a character has reached.
- **Basic** knacks are extraordinary abilities, skills, and talents that some characters possess. Each basic knack be developed once and at any time.
- **Expert** knacks are similar to basic ones, but represent more advanced disciplines. They may each be developed once, but only after a character has reached the sixth level of experience and developed all prerequisite knacks.

The knacks listed here are meant to be a representative list. If you feel that any knacks are missing, you can add them. With a little work it should be easy enough to convert abilities from other games or turn your own new ideas into knacks.

##Core Knacks
The five core knacks are each one way to make your character just a little bit better in a specific dimension. Compared to basic, expert, and odd-leveled knacks they may seem underpowered, but their strength is found from the cumulative effect of repeated selection.

Core knacks may be developed once per level, to a maximum of ten times. Clever and a very clever characters may develop a core knack twice or thrice to begin, increasing their maximum limit to eleven and twelve, respectively.

### Vitality

You can survive what life throws at you.
**Gain three health.**

### Focus

Your aim is true, even in the heat of battle.
**Add one to all attack rolls.**

### Agility

You are deft and an elusive target.
**Add one to defense, unless completely restrained.**

### Reaction

You are fast on your feet.
**Add one to all turn order rolls.**

### Memorization

You have the mind and will to use your magical talents.
**Once per day, you can memorize one of your spells to be cast later.**

## Odd-level Knacks

Magical gifts are represented by the odd-level knacks. Like core knacks, they may be developed multiple times. Unlike core knacks, they may only be developed five times each, once for each odd-numbered level of experience that a character has reached– hence the name.

Another way in which odd-level knacks differ from core knacks is that each level of development may have different effects. In this regard, certain odd-level knacks are to basic and expert knacks, but with more levels of progression.

Either way, these knacks represent long-term paths of growth that a character may follow or simply dabble in.

### Banishing

Your will can turn back spirits, corpsefolk, and other magical beings.
**You may banish nearby magical beings as an action,** dealing one six-sided dice of damage for each level you have developed this knack. These dice may be split between one or more targets.

### Channel Essence

An agonizing power, you have learned to channel a small bit of your own life essence into a bolt of pure energy.
**You may channel your essence at a nearby target as an action,** rolling up to one eight-sided dice of damage for each level you have developed this knack. For each dice you choose to roll this way, lose one health.

### Deceit

It whispered. You listened.
**Each time you develop this knack you gain access to another level of Deceit.**

### Healing Hands

Through your heads or paws courses the will of the gods, mending that which was broken.
For each level you have developed this knack, you may heal six points of damage per day from yourself or a single character that your are touching. This healing may be divided across multiple targets, actions, and scenes.

### Luck

As fate would have it, you are luckier than most.
**Once per day, you may re-roll a single hand of dice that you have rolled, taking the new result.** Additional levels grant additional re-rolls, but you may not re-roll the same hand twice.

## Basic Knacks

These knacks are some of the most varied and eclectic abilities and traits. Each basic knack confers some sort of special ability or bonus, but also represents an important personality point of the character who has developed it. Every basic knack is also a prerequisite for one or more Expert knacks, providing a manner of progression.

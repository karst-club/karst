Knacks are the central element of character development and specialization in Karst. Every character begins with three knacks and develops three more with each additional level of experience. As characters grow and develop certain prerequisites, they gain access to even more powerful and specialized knacks.

There are four categories of knacks:

- **Core** knacks represent central talents that grow with experience and may be developed as often as once per level.
- **Odd-leveled** knacks are magical talents and gifts. They may be developed up to five times each, once for every odd-numbered level of experience a character has reached.
- **Basic** knacks are extraordinary abilities, skills, and talents that some folk possess. Each basic knack be developed once.
- **Expert** knacks build on top of basic ones. They may each be developed once, but only after a character has reached the sixth level of experience and developed any prerequisite basic knacks.

The knacks listed here are meant to be a representative list. If you feel that any knacks are missing, you can add them. With a little work it is easy enough to convert abilities from other games or turn your own ideas into new knacks.

## Core Knacks

The five core knacks make your character just a little bit better in one specific dimension. Compared to basic, expert, and odd-leveled knacks this may seem underpowered, but their strength is found from the cumulative effect of repeated selection.

Core knacks may be developed once per level, for a maximum of ten times. As clever and very clever characters develop a core knack twice or thrice to begin, their maximum limit is increased to eleven and twelve, respectively.

### Vitality

You can survive what life throws at you.

**Gain three health.**

### Focus

Your aim is true, even in the heat of battle.

**Add one to all attack rolls.**

### Agility

You are a deft and elusive target.

**Add one to defense, unless completely restrained.**

### Reaction

You are fast on your feet.

**Add one to all turn order rolls.**

### Memorization

You have the mind and will to use your magical talents.

**You can memorize one spell that you know.**

## Odd-level Knacks

Magical gifts are represented by the odd-level knacks. Like core knacks, they may be developed multiple times. Unlike core knacks, they may only be developed five times each, once for every odd-numbered level of experience that a character has reached – hence the name.

Another way in which odd-level knacks differ from core knacks is that each level of development may have different effects. In this regard, certain odd-level knacks are closer to basic and expert knacks, but with more levels of progression.

Either way, these knacks represent mystical paths of growth that characters may dabble in or follow long term. Once a game has begun, it may be difficult for a character to learn a new odd-level knack without the right teacher.

### Banishing

Your will can turn back spirits, corpsefolk, and other magical beings.

**You may banish nearby magical beings as an action, dealing one six-sided dice of damage for each level you have developed this knack. These dice may be split between one or more targets.**

### Channel Essence

An agonizing power, you have learned to channel a small bit of your own life essence into a bolt of pure energy.

**You may channel your essence at a nearby target as an action, rolling up to one six-sided dice of damage for each level you have developed this knack. For each dice you choose to roll this way, lose one health.**

### Deceit

It whispered. You listened.

**Each time you develop this knack you learn to speak a deeper level of Deceit’s Lies.**

### Healing Hands

Through your hands or paws courses the will of the gods, mending that which is broken.

**For each level you have developed this knack, you may heal six points of damage per day from either yourself or a character that your are touching. This healing may be divided across multiple targets, actions, and scenes.**

### Luck

As fate would have it, you are luckier than most.

**Once per day, you may re-roll a single roll of the dice you have made, taking the new result instead. Additional levels grant additional daily re-rolls, but you may not re-roll the same roll twice.**

### Song

Some folk sing with a most peculiar voice – you are one of them.

**Each time you develop this knack, choose one first level spell from any magical tradition. Once per day, you may sing as an action to cast this spell. During an altercation, it takes two uninterrupted actions across two turns to cast a spell by singing.**

### Fists of Will(?)

Be it by the Will of the Gods, the Spirits, or the strength of your own soul, your fists are imbued with a supernatural energy.

**You roll for damage when attacking without a weapon rather than doing a single point of damage. The type of dice you roll is dependent on the number of times you have developed this knack, starting with a four-sided dice at the first level and increasing by two sides per level, up to a twelve-sided dice the fifth time the knack is developed.**

### Spiritism

In service or in servitude, the spirits guide you.

**Each time you develop this knack you are granted an even higher level of Guidance.**

### Thaumaturgy

You study the Essence of Existence.

**Each time you develop this knack you discover the next level of Transformations.**

### Theurgy

The Gods Above are dead, but their Will still lights your faith.

**Each time you develop this knack you can perform another level of Miracles.**

## Basic Knacks

Along with their expert counterparts, basic knacks represent the broadest group of skills and character traits. Each basic knack confers some sort of special ability or bonus, but also represents an important personality trait of the character who has developed it. Every basic knack is also a prerequisite for one or more Expert knacks, providing a manner of progression.

### Weapon Training

You have trained hard at wielding a particular kind of weapon.

**Choose one kind of weapon. You add one to attack and damage rolls with all weapons of this kind. This knack may be taken once for each kind of weapon.**

### Shield Training

You have learned to use a shield without hindrance.

**You no longer subtract two from attack rolls when using a Shield. As an attack, you may perform a shield bash, which momentarily stuns the target or does a four-sided dice of damage if it hits.**

### Archery

You are one with your bow, especially when given time to aim.

**You may spend a round aiming at a target with your bow before attacking. If you do so, you may choose to add four to either your attack or damage roll, if the attack succeeds.**

### Heavy Armor Training

Even in bulky armor you move with grace.

**You are hindered by heavy armor as if it were only medium armor. Due to their smaller size, lagartos may not develop this knack unless they are strong.**

### Heavy Weapon Training

Other folk may find large weapons unwieldily, but not you.

**You may wield heavy weapons without penalty. Due to their smaller size, Lagartos may not develop this knack unless they are strong.**

### Dual Wielding

You find comfort with a weapon in each hand or paw.

**You add one to all attacks when wielding two weapons. If the two weapons do different amounts of damage, roll a dice to randomly determine which weapon hits.**

### Backstab

Anyone can stab someone else in the back – you’ve made an art of it.

**You quadruple instead of double your damage rolls for any dagger attacks made against unsuspecting targets.**

### Deftness

You are so quick on your feet that armor would only weigh you down.

**You gain two defense when unarmored.**

### Savage Strike

Your blows are particularly violent.

**You add one damage to all attacks.**

### Adversorcery

Your relationship with magic is an uncomplicated one: you despise, distrust, or disbelieve in it so much that it actually has trouble affecting you.

**You roll to resist the effects of all spells, not just the lies of Deceit. Add one to these rolls. The bonus granted to wise characters does not apply to spells other than Deceit.**

### Alertness

You can sense danger before it strikes.

**You are less likely to be surprised by the start of an altercation, adding two to surprise rolls. Lagartos possess a natural version of this knack and may develop its related expert knack as a basic knack, instead.**

### Bravery

Fear is just another enemy to be conquered.

**You are unaffected by fear spells and effects and add one to all morale roles.**

### Clear-Eyed

You can see through many of Deceit’s simpler lies.

### Fitness

**The effects of most poisons and disease are minimal to you. Add two to any resistance rolls against them.**

### Animosity

Your dislike of a particular group is so great that it translates into righteous fervor when you oppose them.

**Choose one group. You add one to any roll made against them. A group may be a type of folk, the residents of a specific place, a type of beast, or any reasonable grouping of characters. This knack may be taken multiple times for multiple groups but does not apply multiple times to characters in multiple groups.**

### Fury

Combat brings out something in you.

**During an altercation, you may enter a furious trance at will, or automatically if you are wounded. During this trance, you add two to all attack and damage rolls, but may not perform any action other than charging towards the nearest foe and attacking. You can not leave this state until the altercation has ended or you are reduced to zero health. After a furious trance, you must rest for a short while or subtract two from all rolls until you do so.**

### Stealth

Your hands are light, your footsteps soft – the shadows are your home.

**You are skilled at avoiding detection and add two to any rolls to do so.**

### Climbing

Walls, cliffs, if it has a few finger holds, you can climb it.

**You are able to climb all but the most sheer surfaces, adding two to any rolls to do so. Eekhorn possess a natural version of this knack and may develop its related expert knack as a basic knack, instead.**

### Tumbling

There is an art to falling – a form of grace, even.

**You suffer far less damage from falling and are not stunned by being knocked over.**

### Technically Minded

Contraptions, mechanisms, fulcrums, levers, causes and effects – you understand how these things operate, and how they can be used in unintended ways.

**You are able to operate and understand most kinds of mechanisms, including locks and small traps, adding two to any rolls involving them.**

### Identify Substances

Poison or salve, causative or cure: distinctions you have learned to discern… with a bit of study.

**You can identify most common and some uncommon poisons, potions, and similar substances with some study, adding two to any roll to do so.**

### Reading

**You can read, or at least partially read, most modern writing. Add two to any rolls to decipher more esoteric scripts, as long as they were still written by folk.**

### Combat Casting

The chaos of battle doesn’t phase your focus; you may cast spells even under duress.

**You may cast spells even while wearing light armor or having been wounded previously in the round.**

### Sense Magic

**You know much about the plants, animals, and natural phenomena around you. Add two to any rolls to identify plants, animals, weather patterns, or similar.**

### Friend to Animals

You have a deep connection with the beasts and birds.

**You are able to calm and even tame most animals. You add two to any roll to calm an animal. If the roll is a six on the dice, you may instead tame the animal – a process that takes a number of hours or even days, depending on the nature of the beast.**

### Hunting

You can feed yourself, among other things.

**You know how to track prey and kill or capture quarry, adding two to any rolls to do so.**

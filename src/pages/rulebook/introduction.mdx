Karst is a role playing game inspired by the classics. The rules are lightweight and easy to modify or use with other systems and content.

The game is set in a fantasy world with many species, but no humans. It eschews the traditional concept of a character class in favor of a simple, configurable, system of character customization.

## Playing

To play, you will need a Narrator and one or more Players. Each Player controls a Character within the game world, while the Narrator controls the world itself, describing it to the Players and determining how it responds to their Charactersâ€™ actions. Collaboratively, the Players and Narrator create a story.

In Karst, you will be talking, rolling dice, and writing things down. Advice about the talking part of the game is sprinked throughout these rules, but is mostly left up to you and your group. Same with most of the details of writing things down, especially any kind of journaling.

This Rulebooks concerns itself mostly with giving you guidance around rolling dice and writing things down that might affect the dice you roll. It also contains all sorts of information to help you create characters and learn a little about the game world.

## Rolling the Dice

You will need a few six-sided dice plus some fancier, polyhedral, dice that have four, eight, ten, twelve, and twenty sides. It can be helpful if everyone has their own six and twenty sided dice.

No matter what dice you are rolling, a higher number is always better.

When rolling a die there will often be a modifier, positive or negative. After rolling, adjust the result by adding or subtracting the modifier. No matter what, a modifier may not bring the result to below 1.

As a shorthand, these rules use standard dice notation to describe different dice rolls. This notation describes the number and type of dice to roll as well as any modifiers to apply to the result. For example, 1d8+2 is shorthand for "roll one eight-sided die and add two to the result".

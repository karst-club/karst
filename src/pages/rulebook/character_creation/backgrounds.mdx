When creating a character, an optional background can be generated at the same time as you roll for starting coins. Follow this procedure to do so.

First, roll a d6 for your character‚Äôs social class:
1. Low - The poorest of the poor
2. Low - Top of the bottom of the barrel
3. Middle - Your family gets by
4. Middle - Your family does fine
5. Upper - Your family is well to do
6. Noble - The cream of the crop

Multiply the result by 10 to get the first portion of your starting coins.

Next, roll a d6 for your character‚Äôs field:
1. Outdoor Activities
2. Culinary Careers
3. Humble Trades
4. The Working Class
5. Respected Professions
6. Educated Occupations

Again, multiply the result by 10 to get the next portion of your starting coins. Then, roll a final d6 and multiply it by 10 for your final portion of starting coins and then look on the appropriate list below to find your background.

This background and social class can be used to inform a character's hook and knacks or can be ignored completely if it doesn't match with what the you have in mind.

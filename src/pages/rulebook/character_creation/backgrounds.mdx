When creating a Character, a background can be generated using the 3d6 roll for starting loot. Roll 1d6 three times, noting each value before summing them up and multiplying by 10 for initial funds. Then, look up a socioeconomic class using the value of the first roll and a sphere and specific background using the values of the second and third rolls on the tables below.

This background can be used to inform a Character's Hook and Knacks or can be ignored completely if it doesn't match with what the Player has in mind.

## Socioeconomic Class

The first of the three dice rolled for starting coins.

1. Low
2. Low
3. Med
4. Med
5. High
6. Noble

## Background

Second and third dice rolled. First of the two represents the Sphere of backgrounds and the second represents the specific one.

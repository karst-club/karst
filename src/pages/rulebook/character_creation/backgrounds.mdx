When creating a character, an optional background can be generated at the same time as you roll for starting coins. Follow this procedure to do so.

First, roll a d6 for your character‚Äôs social class:

1. Low - The poorest of the poor
2. Low - Top of the bottom of the barrel
3. Middle - Your family gets by
4. Middle - Your family does fine
5. Upper - Your family is well to do
6. Noble - The cream of the crop

Jot down your social class as well as the number you rolled.

Next, roll a d6 for your character‚Äôs field:

1. Outdoor Activities
2. Culinary Careers
3. Humble Trades
4. The Working Class
5. Respected Professions
6. Educated Occupations

Note the field and the number you rolled then find the corresponding table for the field below and roll a third time. This will give you your background and a third number, both of which you should write down.

This background and social class can be used to inform a character's hook and knacks or can be ignored completely if it doesn't match with what the you have in mind.

Finally, sum the three numbers you rolled and multiply the total by 10 to determine your character‚Äôs starting coins.

Before the game can begin, each players must create a character. This is a simple process that takes a little time. You will need a few six-sided dice and somewhere to write things down, such as a character sheet.

## Basics

### Species
Start by selecting a species for your character. You can do this by choosing the species you would like to play, or by rolling a d6 to randomly select one. Turn to the next section to learn more about the species and their histories, cultures, and abilities. Once you've selected a species write it down along with the special abilities it grants your character.

### Attributes
Attributes are generated in a semi-random manner, as is tradition. Roll 4d6, drop the lowest value, and sum the remaining three values. Record the sum as your characters strength. Do this five more times to generate all six attributes. Finally, roll a seventh time and optionally replace any one of your six original rolls with the new value.

### Level
Player characters start at level 1 with 0 XP. Write both of these things down.

### Loot and Background
Characters begin with a random amount of coins to purchase starting items. If you do not yet have a background in mind for your character, the roll used to generate starting coins can also be used to determine a background. To do this, turn ahead to the Backgrounds section before continuing on with character creation.

Otherwise, roll 3d6 and multiply the result by 10 to determine how many coins your character starts with. 

## Interlude
At this point you are ready to develop and customize your character. 

There are a few ways of doing this:
- Come up with a concept or backstory for your character and then choose knacks and equipment based on it
- Choose knacks and items that appeal to you or fit your characterâ€™s abilities and then develop a backstory based on those choices
- Some combination of both methods

The instructions that follow assume the second choice.

## Fleshing Things Out
It's time to choose what your character is talented at and what kind of items they have.

### Knacks
Choose three starting knacks and write them down. You can not develop the same knack twice to start. If your knacks grant you spells, write those down too.

### Weapons, Armor, Equipment & Gear
Turn to the Items & Loot section to purchase weapons, armor, equipment, and gear using your starting coins. Some items can only be used if you have the right knack. Other knacks might require you to have a specific item or increase your abilities with certain categories of Items. Keep these facts in mind as you select your starting items.

For each item that you purchase, jot down one or two words describing it. Note how many coins you have remaining, itâ€™s probably good to keep at least a handful.

## Finishing Touches
Now that you have your stats, knacks, and starting items you should be able to fill out the rest of your character sheet. 

There are a number of important stats and values that you can now write down. 

### Hit Points
Characters start with 6 hit points, modified by constitution and any relevant knacks.

### Defense 
Your character starts with a defense of 10, modified by dexterity, the armor you are wearing, and any relevant knacks.

### Offense
Write down the damage values or effects for any weapons or spells you anticipate using as well as any attack bonuses your character might have.

### Hook & Name
Jot down a hook for your character. This should be a sentence or less that sums them up. No need to get too fancy here.

Finally, come up with a name. Now, your character is ready to play.

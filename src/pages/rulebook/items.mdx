Swords, shovels, books, tools, clothing, and coins – items enable character actions. Identity, too, is often wound up in items. Stories are filled with folk who are known more for what they carry or wear than anything else about who they are.

## About Items

Anything that can be used in the hands or paws of a character is considered an item, whether it’s a magical sword filled with unimaginable power, or the branch of a tree, wrenched from the scenery itself.

All items belong to one of three broad types: Common, Special, and Magical.

Most items are of the common type: these are the everyday tools, equipment, and clothes found throughout the archipelago. Some common items may be more difficult to procure than others, but there is otherwise nothing remarkable about them. Remarkable or not, giving individual common items a little bit of personality is encouraged.

Special items, on the other hand, are just that: items which are unique, rare, or incredibly important to the story. These are usually a specific copy of some kind of common item, and can be treated as such. Any details or special functions are handled on a per-item basis.

Lastly, there are Magical items: these extra-special items have been imbued with some form of magical power and are subject to their own rules. Some magical items may share the same powers and effects, but all are unique.

## Using Items

In addition to a type, each item is of a certain kind. These include Weapons, Tools, Armor, Equipment, and Gear. An item’s kind determines how it can be used.

Some kinds of items, such as armor, clothes, and backpacks, are worn. Others, such as weapons and tools are wielded. All items may be carried, either in hand or paw, strapped to a belt, or inside of another item, such as a backpack or pocket.

Characters may wear one set of clothing or armor and carry five items, two of which may be wielded in hand or paw. This limit may be increased by wearing a backpack or carrying a sack. Small items, such as daggers, can be grouped together into bundles of five and treated as a single item for carrying purposes.

An overburdened character will quickly become fatigued after only a few minutes. Characters who are both strong and tough will persevere a little longer, becoming fatigued only after an hour of carrying a few too many things. Regardless of quantity, some items are heavier or bulkier than others and may slow down or otherwise hinder a character who carries, wears, or wields them.

Certain items are consumed with usage. This includes food, ammunition, torches, and other sources of fuel. Other items, such as daggers or lengths of rope, are not inherently consumable, but may be thrown or used in some other disposable manner. Lastly, no item is completely indestructible – anything can be broken with enough effort.

## Coins

There are many currencies found within the Karst Archipelago: from the Gilded Drams of the Floating Cities and the Gold Cupos of the First Serpos Empire, to the all-pervasive Union Crowns minted by the Guilds of the Eastern Woods – but there is only one denomination: the Coin. _No matter the currency, one coin (¢1) is worth as much as the next and all coins are of a similar size and weight. For carrying purposes, a sack or pouch with up to ¢100 is considered a single item._

## Common Items

These are some of the most common items that characters will find and use on their adventures, as well as how much they typically cost.

### Armor & Clothes

A character may wear one suit of armor or clothes and a backpack or bag. A character may also wear a pair of shoes, a hat, a belt, a pair of gloves, and a reasonable amount of jewelry. None of these worn items count against carrying limits.

Unlike clothing, armor offers protection, but also hinders a character in some manner or another, depending on its class:

- **Light** - Hinders spellcasting.
- **Medium** - Hinders climbing, sneaking, and other acrobatic actions.
- **Heavy** - Subtract two from attack rolls and one from all other rolls.

These hindrances are cumulative, with each class suffering the ones of the classes below them. Shields are not armor, but serve a similar function and so they are listed together.

- Plain Clothes - ¢5.
- Artisans Clothes - ¢10, pockets to carry one additional item.
- Leather Armor - ¢20, two defense, light.
- Chainmail(?) Armor - ¢40 - four defense, medium.
- Banded Armor - ¢50 - five defense, heavy.
- Carapace(?) Armor - ¢100 - six defense, heavy.
- Shield - ¢20 - two defense, subtract two from attack rolls.

### Weapons & Ammunition

Weapons are used to do harm. They do this by increasing the amount of damage that an attack does. Wielding a weapon requires one free hand or paw, unless noted otherwise. Some weapons require ammunition to function, consuming it with each attack.

Certain weapons have specific attributes:

- **Large** - These weapons are unwieldily and characters must subtract two from attack rolls made with them.
- **Long** - This weapon is longer than most, allowing a character to attack from a little bit further away, such as behind another character or wall.
- **Ranged** - These weapons are used to attack nearby and far away targets, subtracting four from attack rolls against the latter.
- **Small** - This item may be bundled in groups of five for carrying purposes.
- **Throwable** - This weapon may be thrown at a nearby target as a ranged attack.
- **Two-handed** - This weapon requires both hands or paws to use.
- **Uses & For** - Signifies which ammunition a weapon uses and which weapon(s) an ammunition is for, respectively.

The following list of weapons is by no means complete, but covers most broad categories. When adding your own weapons, you may find it easiest to simply map them to existing ones on this list.

- Staff - ¢5, four-sided damage dice.
- Sling - ¢5 four-sided damage dice, ranged, uses stones.
- Dagger - ¢10, four-sided damage dice, throwable, small.
- Club or Hatchet - ¢10, six-sided damage dice.
- Spear - ¢20, six-sided damage dice, long, throwable.
- Sword or Axe - ¢25 - eight-sided damage dice.
- Big Sword or Axe - ¢50 - ten-sided damage dice, two-handed, large.
- Bow - ¢25, six-sided damage dice, two-handed, ranged, uses arrows.
- Big Bow - ¢75, eight-sided damage dice, two-handed, large, ranged, uses arrows.
- Twenty Five Arrows - ¢5, for bows and big bows.
- Ten Stones - ¢0, for slings.

### Equipment & Gear

There are all sorts of items beyond weapons and armor that characters may find of use in their adventures. Many of these are tools to be used in hand or paw, while others are equipment to be worn. Some gear may even require a bit of set up before usage. As with the weapons and armor lists, this is only a sampling of the types of equipment and gear that can be found throughout the Karst Archipelago.

- Backpack - ¢25, carry three additional items.
- Pouch - ¢10, carry two additional items.
- Rope - ¢5, fifty foot length.
- Book - ¢25, empty or filled with words.
- Small Tent - ¢25, sleeps one, two uncomfortably.
- Large Tent - ¢100, sleeps five, eight uncomfortably.
- Wooden Pole - ¢5, ten feet long.
- Six torches - ¢10, each one burns for one hour.

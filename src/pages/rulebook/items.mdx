Swords, shovels, books, tools, armor and coins – all these and more are Items. Items serve stories the way props serve plays, by enabling characters and their actions. Identity, too, may come from items. Stories are filled with characters who are known more for the items they carry than any other details. When handled properly, items add to the story without bogging it down.

## About Items

Anything that can be used in the hands or paws of a character is considered an item – whether it’s a magical sword filled with unimaginable power, or a simple branch wrenched from the scenery itself.

All items belong to one of three broad types: Common, Special, and Magical.

Most items are of the common type: these are the everyday tools, equipment, and clothes found throughout life. Some common items may be more difficult to procure than others, but there is otherwise nothing remarkable about them. Still, giving each common items a little personality is encouraged, especially those belonging to important characters.

Special items, on the other hand, are just that: items which are unique, rare, or incredibly important to the story. These are usually just a specific copy of some kind of common item, and can mostly be treated as such.

Lastly, there are Magical items: these extra special items have been imbued with some form of magical power and are subject to their own special rules. Some magical items may share the same powers and effects, but all are unique.

In addition to type, there are many kinds of items, including: Weapons, Tools, Armor, Equipment, and Gear.

## Using Items

Some items, such as armor and clothes, are worn. Others, such as weapons and tools can be wielded or used in some other manner. All items may be carried, either in hand, strapped to a belt, inside of another item, such as a backpack or pocket.

Characters may wear one set of clothing or armor and carry five items, two of which may be wielded in hand or paw. This limit may be increased by wearing a backpack or carrying a sack. Small items, such as daggers, can be grouped together into bundles of five and treated as a single item for carrying purposes.

A character who goes much above this limit will quickly become fatigued, unless they are strong and tough. Some items are heavier or bulkier than others and may slow down or otherwise hinder a character on their very own; this is particularly the case with armor.

Most items may be used over and over again, but certain items are consumed with usage. This includes food, ammunition, torches, and other sources of fuel. Other items, such as daggers or lengths of rope, are not inherently consumable, but may be thrown or used in some other disposable manner. Lastly, no item is completely indestructible– anything can be broken with enough effort.

## Coins

There are many currencies within the Karst Archipelago: from the Gilded Drams of the Floating Cities and the Gold Cupos of the First Serpos Empire, to the all pervasive Union Crowns minted by the Guilds of the Eastern Woods – but there is only one denomination: the Coin.

No matter the currency, one coin (¢1) is worth as much as the next. To keep things simple, it can also be assumed that all coins are of a similar size and weight. For carrying purposes, a sack or pouch with up to ¢100 is considered a single item.

## Common Items

These are some of the most common items that characters will find and use on their adventures. Grouped by kind, each item’s listing contains its name, description, and the average cost it goes for in the archipelago.

### Armor & Clothes

A character may wear one suit of armor or clothes. A character may also wear a pair of shoes, a hat, a belt, a pair of gloves, and a reasonable amount of jewelry.

Armor hinders a character in some manner or another, depending on what class it is:

- Light - Hinders spellcasting.
- Medium - Hinders climbing, sneaking, and other acrobatic actions.
- Heavy - Subtract two from attack rolls and one from all other rolls.

These hindrances are cumulative, with each class suffering the ones of the classes below them. Shields are not armor, but serve a similar function and so they are listed together.

- Plain Clothes - ¢5.
- Artisans Clothes - ¢10, pockets to carry one additional item.
- Leather Armor - ¢20, two defense, light.
- Chainmail(?) Armor - ¢40 - four defense, medium.
- Banded Armor - ¢50 - five defense, heavy.
- Carapace(?) Armor - ¢100 - six defense, heavy.
- Shield - ¢20 - two defense, subtract two from attack rolls.

### Weapons & Ammunition

Weapons are used to do harm. They do this by increasing the amount of damage that an attack does. Wielding a weapon requires one free hand or paw, unless noted otherwise. Certain weapons require ammunition to function, consuming it with each attack.

Certain weapons have specific attributes:

- Heavy - These weapons are unwieldley and characters subtract two from attack rolls made with them.
- Long - This weapon is longer than most, allowing a character to attack from a little further away.
- Ranged - These weapons are used to attack nearby and far targets, subtracting four from attack rolls against the latter.
- Small - This item may be bundled in groups of five for storage and carrying purposes.
- Throwable - This weapon may be thrown at a nearby target as a ranged attack.
- Two-handed - This weapon requires both hands to use.
- Uses / For - Signifies which ammunition a weapon uses and which weapon(s) an ammunition is for, respectively.

The following list of weapons is by no means complete, but it does cover most categories. When adding your own weapons, you may find it easiest to simply map them to existing ones on this list.

- Staff - ¢5, four-sided damage dice.
- Sling - ¢5 four-sided damage dice, ranged, uses stones.
- Dagger - ¢10, four-sided damage dice, throwable, small.
- Club or Hatchet - ¢10, six-sided damage dice.
- Spear - ¢20, six-sided damage dice, long, throwable.
- Sword or Axe - ¢25 - eight-sided damage dice.
- Big Sword or Axe - ¢50 - ten-sided damage dice, two-handed, heavy.
- Bow - ¢25, six-sided damage dice, two-handed, ranged, uses arrows.
- Big Bow - ¢50, eight-sided damage dice, two-handed, heavy, ranged, uses arrows.
- Twenty Five Arrows - ¢5, for bows and big bows.
- Ten Stones - ¢0, for slings.

### Tools & Gear

There are all sorts of items beyond weapons and armor that characters may find useful in their adventures. Many of these are tools to be used in hand or paw, while others are equipment to be worn. Some gear even requires a bit of set up before usage. As with the weapons and armor lists, this is just a sampling of the types of items that can be found in the game.

- Backpack - ¢25, carry three additional items.
- Pouch - ¢10, carry two additional items.
- Rope - ¢5, fifty foot length.
- Book - ¢25, empty or filled with words.
- Small Tent - ¢25, sleeps one, two uncomfortably.
- Large Tent - ¢100, sleeps five, eight uncomfortably.
- Wooden Pole - ¢5, ten feet long.
- Six torches - ¢10, each one burns for one hour.

Swords, shovels, books, tools, armor and coins– all these and more are Items. Items serve stories the way props serve plays– by enabling characters and their actions. Identity, too, may come from items; stories are filled with characters who are known more for the items they carry than any other details. When handled properly, items add to the story without bogging it down.

## About Items

Anything that can be used in the hands or paws of a character is considered an item– whether it’s a magical sword filled with unimaginable power, or a simple branch wrenched from the scenery itself.

All items belong to one of three broad types: Common, Special, and Magical.

Most items are of the common type: these are the everyday tools, equipment, and clothes found throughout life. Some common items may be more difficult to procure than others, but there is otherwise nothing remarkable about them. Still, giving each common items a little personality is encouraged, especially those belonging to important characters.

Special items, on the other hand, are just that: items which are unique, rare, or incredibly important to the story. These are usually just a specific copy of some kind of common item, and can mostly be treated as such.

Lastly, there are Magical items: these extra special items have been imbued with some form of magical power and are subject to their own special rules. Some magical items may share the same powers and effects, but all are unique.

In addition to type, there are many kinds of items, including: Weapons, Tools, Armor, Equipment, and Gear.

## Using Items

Some items, such as armor and clothes, are worn. Others, such as weapons and tools can wielded in the hands and paws of characters or used in some other manner. All items may be carried, either in hand, strapped to a belt, inside of a pocket or another item, such as a backpack.

Characters may wear one set of clothing or armor and carry five items, two of which may be wielded in hand or paw. This limit may be increased by wearing a backpack or carrying a sack. Small items, such as daggers, can be grouped together into bundles of five and treated as a single item for carrying purposes.

A character who goes much above this limit will quickly become fatigued, unless they are strong and tough. Some items are heavier or bulkier than others and may slow down or otherwise hinder a character on their very own; this is particularly the case with armor.

Most items may be used over and over again, but some items are consumed with usage. This includes food, ammunition, torches, and other sources of fuel. Other items, such as daggers or lengths of rope, are not inherently consumable, but may be thrown or used in some other disposable manner. Lastly, no item is completely indestructible– anything can be broken with enough effort.

## Common Items

These are some of the most common items that characters will find and use on their adventures. Listed by kind, each item’s listing contains its name, a simple description, and the average cost it goes for in the archipelago.

### Armor & Clothes

A character may wear one suit of armor or clothes. A character may also wear a pair of shoes, a hat, a belt, a pair of gloves, and a reasonable amount of jewelry. All armor hinders a character in some manner or another, depending on what class it is. There are three classes of armor:

- Light - Hinders spellcasting.
- Medium - Hinders climbing, sneaking, and other acrobatic actions.
- Heavy - Suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls and a -1 penalty to all other rolls.

These hindrances are cumulative, with each class suffering the ones of the classes below them. Shields are not armor, but serve a similar function and so they are listed together.

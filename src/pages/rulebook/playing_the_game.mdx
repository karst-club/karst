_Karst is played as a shared dialog between the players and the narrator._ These rules provide a framework for how that dialog is conducted and how dramatic situations can be resolved using creativity, judgment, and chance.

## The Two Rules

In truth, there are only two rules to the game of Karst – the rest are just suggestions.

_The first rule is to be reasonable._ There are many places in between the rules as written and the stories you tell that will be left up to your taste and judgment. It is assumed that you will approach these areas with good faith, whether as a player or narrator. Where there are unspoken rules and uncertainty in the text, search not for loopholes but apply common sense rulings instead. Better yet, view these gaps as opportunities to incorporate the ideas and house rules that best fit the needs of your game and story.

_The second rule, which builds heavily upon the first, is to serve the story._ The goal of the game is not for one party or another to win, but for you to tell a story together with you friends. No matter your role in the telling, it is your objective to nurture the narrative and help it along, adding your own marks in the process.

In a sense, these two rules are one: Though the characters may be opposed, Karst is played together.

## Stories

Whether it’s a short adventure in an evening’s time, or an entire saga played out over months and even years, _the game of Karst is about creating stories._ The narrator may have the rough outline of a story in mind, or things may be more open ended, but most stories will have some kind of beginning, middle, and eventual end – even if they aren’t obvious from the start.

Stories may, themselves, be part of a larger epic or may, in turn, have smaller stories within them, each with their own beginning, middle, and end. Often, the end of one story serves as beginning of another.

It’s up to you how you would like to structure these things, but the concept of the story is a helpful measurement and building block through which your tales can be told.

# Scenes

No matter how else they are structured, _stories are made up of Scenes._ **These are the events and interactions that matter to the players and their understanding of the plot.**

_A scene is a dialog._ It typically begins with the narrator describing the situation. Next, the players ask the narrator any questions they might have about the scene or state any actions that their characters are taking.

The narrator answers questions as they see fit and describes the outcome of character actions, noting how the scene has changed as a result. If there are other characters or creatures in the scene, the narrator may also describe what actions they are taking.

This continues back and forth until the scene reaches a conclusion, transitioning to another scene or ending the current part of the story.

## Actions

_If a player wants their character to do something, they say so – this is called an Action._

**Actions generally happen.**

The narrator narrates the result of the action, or invites the player to do so. Sometimes, the narrator will determine that the character has failed or is unable to perform the action, describing instead the failure.

**Creative player actions should almost always be rewarded by the narrator.** This encourages emergent storytelling and player engagement more than just about anything else.

## Action Rolls

_When the narrator can’t decide the outcome of an action, they may ask for a roll of the dice to determine what happens – this is called an Action Roll._

**Action rolls are the core mechanic of Karst.**

_To make an action roll, the player or narrator rolls a six-sided dice._ If the roll results in a six or higher, the action is a success. Otherwise, it is a failure. There are often modifiers that add to or subtract from the result of the roll, but if the dice shows a one, the action ends in failure. Similarly, if the dice shows a six, the action is successful.

**Action rolls may be used for many purposes.** For example, when something horrible is about to happen to a character, the narrator may ask their player to roll to avoid some or all of the effects – this is called a Reaction Roll.

Opposed contests, too, may be handled with action rolls. Both sides make action rolls to see if one prevails over the other.

When the outcome of an action roll would not be immediately apparent to the player performing it, the narrator may roll in secret, revealing the result when it is appropriate.

**An important note about action rolls is that they should be used sparingly.**

Players are meant to be rewarded for their creativity, their characters are capable folk, and rolls should not be made just for the sake of rolling dice. Limiting action rolls to the big moments in a game makes their outcomes more memorable and impactful.

That said, it’s your game to play and if you like rolling dice for every last action, go for it.

# Altercations

Scenes are generally free-flowing discussions, but there are moments when the order in which characters act and things occur becomes more important. _When some form of confrontation arises between characters, such as an argument or fight, the scene becomes an Altercation._

A slightly more structured way of handling the action, altercations can also be used for other moments of dramatic tension within the story.

## Rounds & Order

_An altercation is made up of successive Rounds._ During a round, each character is given a Turn to act. _At the beginning of a round, each player involved in the altercation makes an action roll to determine their character’s order in the in round – this is called an Order Roll._ The narrator, similarly, makes an order roll for any characters they control.

_Going from highest roll to lowest, characters take their turns._ Characters with the same roll act at the same time.

Altercations often start in a surprising manner. _If there is a chance that a character would be caught unaware, they must first succeed at an action roll or be surprised and unable to act during the altercation’s opening round._

## Turns

_On their turn, a character is given the opportunity to take one action._ They may also walk a short distance or say a few words, but anything beyond that is an action itself. A character may not defer their action – they must act now or forfeit the opportunity.

## Attacks

Altercations often turn violent. In these situations – or any other time that a character wishes to do harm – they may use an action to Attack a target, such as another character or inanimate object.

_To make an attack, the player or narrator rolls a twenty-sided dice, succeeding if the result is equal to or above the target’s Defense score. This is called an Attack Roll._ Like action rolls, attack rolls often have modifiers. Another similarity between the two is what happens on a high or low roll. No matter the modifiers or the target’s defense, an attack always fails if the dice shows a one and always succeeds if the dice shows a twenty.

## Damage

_A successful attack does Damage to the target._ Damage is generally determined by the type of weapon being used, but all attacks do at least one damage, even unarmed ones.

_Once the damage of an attack has been determined, it is subtracted from the target’s Health. A target whose health has been reduced to zero or less has either been knocked unconscious or killed and is knocked-out of the altercation either way._

## Resolution

_At the end of each round, the narrator decides if the altercation has ended or if it should continue._ If one side has been defeated, that’s generally the end of it, but there are other reasons why an altercation might end, some more peaceful than others.

An altercation’s resolution may return the action to the scene at hand, or it may transition the game to a new scene or conclude a part of the story. In some cases, the conclusion of an altercation could even end the story, tragically or heroically.

## Morale

The players are free to keep their characters involved in an altercation as long as they like, but many of the other characters and creatures in the world have an innate sense of self-preservation. _When a group of narrator-controlled characters has their first member knocked-out of an altercation and again when at least half of the group has been knocked-out, the remainder must roll to test their nerves._

This Morale Roll is handled like any other action roll, often with modifiers. One roll is made for the group and if they succeed, they stay in the altercation. Failure means that they will retreat, bargain, or surrender, as appropriate. _Morale rolls are also made by allies of the player’s characters._

# Injury & Death

Altercations have consequences, some of which are physical. A character’s Health is an abstract representation of their physical well-being, mental stamina, fortitude, resolve, and even luck. As a character loses health, the closer they come to a breaking point.

A character who has lost some of their health is harried and perhaps lightly wounded, nothing that can’t be cured by a warm meal and bit of rest– but those who have lost all of their health are in serious trouble. For starters, they are knocked unconscious for the rest of the encounter. Even worse, they have a good chance of dying, especially if left unattended.

_Immediately after being reduced to zero health or less, a character must make make a type of action roll called a Death Roll, subtracting any negative health from the result._ If the result is one, the character has died. If the dice shows a six, the character is wounded but will survive. Any other result means the character remains at death’s door and must roll again at the end of the next round.

_Another character may use their action and attempt to administer aid with an action roll._ A successful roll has the same effect as if the injured character had succeeded at their death roll. A failure reduces the target’s health by one, rather than outright killing them.

## Recovery

Characters who have lost some of their health have various ways of regaining it. _A hot meal and a good night’s sleep will restore all lost health,_ but there are other methods when one is in a pinch.

_Sitting down for an hour and eating a meal is an effective pick me up. Any character that does this regains three health._ This can be done up to twice a day, beyond that is a waste of time and food.

Magical spells, abilities, and potions are often the fastest way of restoring lost health, but also the most scarce. Some magical effects are even capable of temporarily increasing health above its maximum value.

_A character who has lost all of their health must recuperate before adventuring again._ After being carried back to safety and shelter, they must spend at least a full week in bed. Once fully recuperated, a character is restored to full health, but may have some kind of permanent scar or injury.

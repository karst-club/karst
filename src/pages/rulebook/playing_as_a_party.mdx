Unless you are a solo player, playing together as a party is an important part of the game. Of course, playing together doesn't automatically mean cooperation. Some of the most interesting and fun stories come from casts of characters that don't always get along. What matters most, however, is that you as players are enjoying the interactions and the story. Some groups may love a lot of drama between player characters, while others might enjoy playing as a unified team. Above all else, it's about how you want to play the game.

Most of the following "rules" are more suggestions than anything and should be modified to fit your group's tastes and preferences.

## Party Roles

Parties and players can operate more efficiently if they designate and delegate certain tasks. This has the additional benefits of reducing the narratorâ€™s workload and creating more content for the game in the form of maps and journals. Depending on the size and needs of the group, some or all of the following roles may be worth assigning to certain players or characters. It's up to you if you want the players or their characters to be the ones performing the roles and whether or not they rotate between adventures.

### Mappers, Journalists, and Bookkeepers

Karst is a game about exploration. Having someone map where you are going and where you have been when you are out in the wilderness, delving into dungeons, or even navigating a town can prevent you from getting lost and help you find your way back again. Besides, it can be just plain fun to have cool maps of imaginary places.

Similarly, a diary or log of things that have occurred can make it easier to pick up where the group left off in between sessions and makes for a great post-game memento. In fact, a diary can be a great way to turn a game of Karst into a short story or novella, if you want to go all out.

Much of the motivation that led to Karst came from the desire to have a system that lent itself to creating stories that could be shared with and appreciated by more than just the players of the game. Of course documenting a game takes time and isn't for everyone, there is no requirement that you have to or anything like that.

Whether or not you want to journal and map your adventures, pretty much every party needs some kind of shared ledger or inventory. It helps to have an appointed bookkeeper maintain it. Unless your group instantly divvies up the loot and takes an everyone for themselves approach to things, you are going to have a few shared items, treasures, and concerns. If you are really lucky, you might even have a whole ship to worry about. Unless you have someone keeping track of it, it can be easy for shared items to go missing.

### Ships, Shared Loot, and Going Concerns

Players may find it useful to acquire a ship and it will probably take all of them to pilot it well and play a part in how it goes.

Karst is a role playing game inspired by the classics, new and old. **The object of the game is to create a story together with your friends.** It features simple rules, an emphasis on storytelling, and a haunted archipelago filled with cute animal folk and terrible secrets.

Karst eschews the traditional concept of character classes in favor of a simple and flexible system of character customization. The rules are lightweight and easy to modify or use with other systems and content.

## Playing

**To play, you will need a Narrator and one or more Players.** Each player controls a character within the game world while the narrator controls the world itself, setting the stage, describing it to the players, and determining how the world responds to the actions of their characters.

**In Karst, you will be talking and writing things down. Sometimes, you will roll dice.** Advice about how to conduct the talking part of the game is sprinkled throughout these rules, but is much is left up to you and your group. The same goes for most of the details around writing things down, especially journaling, which is highly encouraged.

This rulebook concerns itself mostly with giving you guidance around when to roll dice and the things that might affect those rolls. It also contains all sorts of information to help you create characters and stories as well as learn a bit about the game world.

Additional books and pamphlets published by the _Karst Archipelago Historical Society_ and others contain more information about the world of Karst. We sincerely hope you end up adding to this body of work.

## Rolling the Dice

Karst does not have a huge emphasis on rolling dice, but they are an important tool for determining certain outcomes. As such, you will need a few six-sided dice plus some fancier ones that have four, eight, ten, twelve, and twenty sides. It can be helpful if everyone has their own set.

**No matter what dice you are rolling, in Karst, a higher number is always better.**

When rolling the dice there will often be modifiers, positive and negative. After rolling, adjust the result by adding or subtracting any modifiers. **A modifier may not bring the result of a roll below one.**

A kingdom known for its mighty warriors, Thark is a proud and insecure culture.

Citizens of Thark praise honesty and forthright behavior; Deceit is shunned.

#Overview
The nation of Thark is comprised of two large and hilly islands as well as a number of smaller ones. The largest island, Thark Minora, is one of the the largest islands in the archipelago.

The weather in Thark is generally fair, with long, warm, summers and cool, occasionally damp, winters.

The Vineyards of Thark are a lovely place, especially in the warmer months. Tharkians are known to wear distinctive broad hats to shade themselves from the sun in this region.

In the mountains of Thark the winters often bring snow, with many residents and visitors seeking warmth and comfort in the region’s many natural hot springs.

An unabashed monarchy, Thark is currently ruled by King Groedsun. He is a very large and mostly benevolent smoothskin visita.

King Agatón Dromedi was the beloved founder and first ruler of Thark during the age of The Grand Warriors of Thark!

Thark has a royal court and nobility, but relatively low levels of political intrigue, as most disagreements are out in the open.

The culture is an active one and many folk engage in hunting, mountaineering, and other physical activities or seek glory in the ranks of the military or as adventurers.

> The Gateway to Adventure

_“You could seek good coin for this in Porta Cortu perhaps, but not out here.”_ - Ragna, merchant on Gygalos Island

Porta Cortu is a small and densely populated chain of rocky islands inhabited by a rowdy and industrious collection of groups and individuals. Each major island is divided into as many as a dozen different districts and burrows, each governed by their own council, administrative department, syndicate, petty tyrant, or similar.

Home to many eccentrics, artisans, merchants, shipbuilders, sailors, money changers, petty nobles, beggars, diplomats, retired adventurers, treasure hunters, and iconoclasts, those seeking an adventure can usually find one here.

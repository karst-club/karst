Eektorp Bay is a hustling and bustling town with aspirations of city-hood.

It is ruled by The Duke, a corpulent autocrat.

Nearby is the large slum of Hoveltun.

It is also ruled by The Duke, who occasionally looks down on it from his castle in disgust, but otherwise pays it no mind (unless the taxes are late).

A sharp and able-bodied deckhand can find themselves a half-dozen different offers to sign on with one Going Concern or another down at the docks.

It‚Äôs no Drakt harbor, but the thieving scene in Eektorp Bay and Hoveltun is pretty cutthroat.

In the Mirror Sea there is a large chain of islands known as the Karst Archipelago.

The archipelagoâ€™s climate ranges from subarctic to tropical but, by and large, the islands are of mediterranean climate and landscape.

Much of the archipelago is part of a large limestone formation, and is riddled with caves and underground pools.

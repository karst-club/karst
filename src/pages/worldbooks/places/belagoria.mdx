The merchant kingdom of Belagoria is a prosperous nation state on the precipice of turmoil, war, and disaster.

Ever at odds with its neighbor Golandra, long simmering tensions between Belagoria and its rival threaten to erupt into outright war.

Internally, too, the merchant kingdom faces strife, as farmers, porters, and other lower-class folk band together to push back against the excesses and wealth of the noble merchant families.

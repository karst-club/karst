_A downtempo post-apocalyptic role playing game with themes of adventure, exploration, and soft terror._

Karst is a way to create stories. This site contains the rules and setting of Karst, stories that have been created with it, and perhaps some notes about how and why this all came to be.

Some day we may create more tools for creating stories and put them here as well.

We highly encourage you to create, share, and even publish your own stories, rules, and source material for Karst.

If you do end up wanting to publish things, we have a couple of guidelines. To learn about them, or if you'd like to see the source code and raw content for all of this, you can do so [here](https://github.com/karst-club/karst).

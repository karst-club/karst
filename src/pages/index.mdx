_In the center of the Mirror Sea lies the Karst Archipelago._

_Once surrounded by the continents, it has been a generation since the last ships arrived from those distant shores._

_Life has gone on for the folk out here._

_Small communities, island kingdoms, and nation states have formed from the old refugee settlements, pirate hideouts, and trading outposts._

_Much remains unexplored._

_Ancient ruins, lost treasure, and uncharted islands beckon. Yet, there is a peculiar and sorrowful feeling here._

_Tragedy has befallen the Karst Archipelago, grasping it in a slow, tender, and fatal embrace._

_The end is near, but it is still a chapter or two away._

**Welcome, fellow authors.**

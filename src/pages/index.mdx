# Karst

_In the center of the Mirror Sea lies the Karst Archipelago._

_Once surrounded by the Three Distant Shores, it has been a generation since the last ships arrived from those faraway lands._

<br />

_Life has gone on for the folk out here._

_Small communities, island kingdoms, and nation states have formed out of old refugee settlements, pirate camps, and trading outposts._

<br />

_Much remains unexplored._

_Ancient ruins, lost treasure, and uncharted islands beckon. Yet, there is a peculiar and sorrowful feeling here._

<br />

_Tragedy has befallen the Karst Archipelago, grasping it in a slow, tender, and fatal embrace._

_The end is near, but it is still a few chapters away._

<br />

## Beetles of Gygalos Island

The beetle is a vital part of the Gygalos ecosystem and depended on by folk for both
food and materials. The beetle's chitin is fashioned into various items which can be
traded at the Carapacerea in Poe Village.

### Fire Beetle

These beetles are highly prized for their glowy parts.

### Tiger Beetle

These large beetles travel in packs, and are highly interested in both food and movement. They
have wounded brave Gygalos warriors and are best avoided.

## Forest Crab

Some adventurers have sworn up and down that packs of large crabs roam the inland jungles, but
the residents of Poe Village say it isn't true.

## Quartz Statues

About 1.5x the size of a typical Folk, these statues are also known as Crystal Crabs and have
been spotted by villagers of Poe and are widely considered to be a bad omen. Only a few
adventurers have come back with tall tales of these statues coming to life and attacking,
but many have seen them mysteriously appear and disappear on the island.

## Undead Sailors

Allegedly, a beetle-hunting party was recently attacked by some rotting pirate corpses who
were apparently re-animated by some unholy force.

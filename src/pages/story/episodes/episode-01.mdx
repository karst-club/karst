## Session 1

### 8/24/20

Sailboat, The Derrington, is sailing from Belagoria to Eektorp Bay. We are a few days away.

The Derrington crashes overnight and we wash ashore.

We see some simple fisher folk and boats among the wreckage.

Sergio is fretting and trying to help other injured Folk.

A Veldling Magistrate (Anki) seems to be badly injured or at least very shaken up. Their one servant who survived is not making it easy to tell if the help is truly needed.

Sergio checks on Foot, who is most concerned with why Woggles would allow this to happen.

Wilandra is walking it off and doesn‚Äôt believe in healing spells.

Multiple little kids on this boat running up to people and asking if people are ok? Where are we?

GyGalos Island?

Local kids point down the coast to their home village.

All of our stuff is in treasure chests that are being hauled ashore by the local Folk.

Foot swims out to the treasure chests while the other Folk head towards the village to rendezvous with the treasure salvaging boats.

Foot meets a local Lagartos woman named Coralia. They speak of the weather - storms like this were rare here until recently. Many were lost in the storm.

The town has plaster and terracotta buildings set back from an artificial bay where sailboats are docked.

Drakt Harbor is nearby, there are pirates there.

An old local (Arti) says: ‚ÄúShips don‚Äôt stop by Gygalos Island very often‚Ä¶ You can stay in the Inn for a coin per night... The locals have work if you lack coin... The local fish is the Midnight Rayfish that comes out at night‚Ä¶ we only have fishing boats on the island‚Äù

Twice as many buildings as people around here? Buildings in disrepair?

The youth used to go light fires at the lighthouse, but after the third one didn‚Äôt come back they stopped.

Foot goes shopping - speaking with Ragna, the merchant of Rigor Shack. She offers a shell necklace for trade with an empty chest, and when Foot asks about buying food she points out the fish dryers. Foot trades the empty chest for the shell necklace and walks over to the fish dryers. Where he meets with middle aged grevling interacting with fish and successfully trades the necklace for some fish.

Sergio slinks over to the Carapaceria. Lots of things in town are made with Beetle carapaces. We learn that the glowy part of Fire Beetles is valued by the fisherfolk.

Sergio is spreading a lot of knowledge about the beautiful soul and spirit of beetles.

The group encounters a gang of 4 giant crabs. After a quick assessment we decide to run from them. We run 10 minutes into a palm tree forest. Then as we are discussing the logistics of crab trapping we are happened upon by a group of 3 Folk quietly walking towards us.

Too quietly.

‚ÄúWho goes there?!‚Äù Glenn gruffly yells but to no response. One of the Folk is missing half the skin on their face. The other has a bony arm clutching a sword. They are dressed in Pirates attire.

Sergio has heard about the Undead but never witnessed them. Foot goes charging in.

Battle time! Vs. undead Folk

Foot aims a slash at the nearest Undead with his sword, shearing off one arm but unfortunately not the same arm which was holding its weapon.

Wilandra strikes out with her sword at a different Zombie, and her blow glances off its own weapon.

The zombie engaged with Foot attacks back for 1 point of damage.

The zombie engaged with Wilandra fumbles and loses its turn.

The last zombie, yet to be engaged, goes for Foot. He strikes a blow against Foot‚Äôs scale mail armor but ultimately does not deal damage.

Glenn strikes out against the third Zombie and manages to Dis-Arm them (off-arm)

Sergio mounts a running spear-stab towards the Zombie engaged with Foot. His spear finds an opening between the Zombie‚Äôs ribs with a hesitating yet effective puncture which causes the first Zombie to collapse into a heap on the ground.a

Glenn is hopping mad! üê∏üí¢ swings savagely again against his Zombie opponent a second time. His sword cleaves through the Zombie‚Äôs head and it falls to the floor lifeless.

Foot attacks the last standing Zombie with his two handed sword. Running behind the Zombie he stabs it with ease, his blade squelching through multiple internal organs but the stubborn Zombie remains standing.

It readies its blade at Wilandra but her sword is at the ready. She swings at the neck and its head flies off and lands a few feet away, the hat falling right at Wilandra‚Äôs feet. She pounds her sword into the head for good measure.

Zombie Pirate‚Äôs Journal says: Cove on north end of the island, occasionally Drakt Harbor, found treasure, some of the crew, after bickering, left to go try to find some loot, others went to confront them.

Everyone gets +7 coins, plus the group loot is +2 coins and +1 journal.

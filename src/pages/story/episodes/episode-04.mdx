## Session 4 - 11/9/20

Foot, Renske and Sergio are by the door; Wilandra and Glenn hide behind stalactites.

As we hear noises from the center tunnel, a group of people unsurprisingly comes through the center tunnel. It sounds like 4 folk. We hear them discussing the presence of crabs.

They walk past and the group deliberates about whether to follow or not, which corridor to go down. Renske points out her dead crewmate Percival stuck in a trap at the top tunnel, apparently freshly dead. Glenn checks his pockets and the group finds 25 coins, and his leather armor is in good condition as well. It looks like he was done in by a sharp blade.

The group considers laying noise traps at the entrances to the other corridors.

The center corridor continues for 12 feet before ending in a door. Foot charges in and puts his ear to the door. On the other side of the door apparently an animated discussion is going on among concerned parties. They seem to be discussing what to do about Freshly Dead Percival. Wilandra rigs the door with another noise trap, the group retreats back to the main cavern and begins to examine Freshly Dead Percival. There are lots of killy traps all around the cave but especially this corridor. There are some traps between us and Percival but we can avoid them. Beyond Percival’s body we do see some traps that have been activated and even some crab parts laying on the ground.

Sergio suggests that we take the southern cavern and follow the group of Folk we saw walking earlier. The crab carnage passageway is just a little too scary for us. Before too long we find the light at the end of the tunnel, just at the shoreline with a small cliff, a few crates, and a small rowboat tied up nearby. This location may be inaccessible during high tide, but the tunnel stays dry. The tunnel itself is about level grade.

Sergio cracks open a crate, finding various and sundry items inside. Rations, dinnerware, clothes, and 275 coins, and a ring! We stealthily pillage the crates.

Wilandra gets a bad vibe from the ring, but Sergio’s eyes light up and he slips it onto his finger. There’s no apparent effect. Foot wants to go back to Freshly Dead Percival cavern.

Wilandra: “Y’know, my friend once found a magic wand in a crate. She saw some monsters, and she tried to defeat them with the wand. But all it did was make people smile. No magic is good magic, I’m tellin’ ya. She wasn’t smilin’ by the end of that fight.”

Foot has convinced Glenn to return to the northern passage, but Stubborn Wilandra is skeptical. The crab people must be powered by something. Foot wants to find the treasure! With Sergio on her side, Wilandra convinces Glenn to instead explore the corridor leading northward from the water cave entrance. As we walk the downward-sloping passage the air becomes cooler. It appears to be a natural opening.

We enter into a larger chamber that is lit by fire beetle nodules. We can see that part of the cave is naturally formed while the other half has clearly been mined. Across the chamber we see another tunnel leading downward. To the left of that far tunnel we see another natural tunnel where the body of a giant crab (non-crystal) with a sword stuck in its head. This crab has been dead for a while and it stinks. Glenn hops over to the dead crab, puts his boot on the crab and pulls the sword free. He swings it about a bit then sticks it in his belt.

At the end of the hallway we see another door similar construction to the first door. Sergio creeps up to the door and sets his ear against the smooth surface, and hears nothing. We open a door that leads to another pair of doors. Foot just chooses the right hand door and opens it. We see crates and barrels, shovels, pickaxes, and another door. Foot ignores all the loot and then goes straight to the right hand door.

In the next room we see a golden array of riches with a quartz crab statue on a pedestal in the center. It appears to be an altar. Wilandra has extra bad feelings about the statue. There are robes and chests. There is a huge ruby in front of the crab statue worth at least 50 coins. Foot grabs the gem and chucks it in his bag. The robes look similar to that Daan was wearing. The symbology does not seem like any religion that we are familiar with.

Sergio cracks open a crate to the tune of 2,430 coins and a bunch of other stuff. There’s a big glass jar that contains an ultralight liquid.

Wilandra is transfixed by the statue, staring and wondering what to do. She gets a bad feeling. She hears a sniffling, almost sobbing noise coming from behind the altar. She immediately looks behind the altar, where a wide-eyed Lagartos child looks up in fear, exclaiming “Don’t hurt me!”

“What are you doing here?” Wilandra barks.

“I.. I was playing with my friends.. And then there were crabs.. And I was running…” the young one snivels as he slowly expounds on the story that unfolded for him the last day. He witnessed Daan come to pray to the Crab Statue, and was “saying scary things” to it. “He told it to watch and to make sure that it saw everything.”

Sergio scrupules the beady crab eyes of the statue. Wilandra covers the whole statue with a rug, which brings everyone a bit of comfort.

“The ring has changed you, man.” Wilandra complains, as Sergio convinces the rest of the party to go search more unopened doors and keep the kid in tow for the time being. The kid, Pipo Pero takes Glenn’s old sword. But it’s really heavy.

Behind the next unopened door, a group of folk can be heard participating in a popular card game. The group’s feeling is to open every door that does NOT apparently contain folks behind it.

Going back to the other door, we find makeshift sleeping quarters. There is a smell to the place. A few folk appear to be getting ready. Foot and Sergio are surprised! Wilandra and Glenn biff their initiative, while two folks grab their sword while the other looks at us and gestures with his hand, incanting something. At this point the room before us is enveloped in inky blackness.

Wilandra grabs Foot while Glenn dashes forward to grab the door handle and pulls it closed with all his strength.

Wilandra grabs 2 bars of soap seemingly out of nowhere and falls to her knees, painting the floor with the slippery substance. Sergio is used to yelling threats through doors, and he starts bellowing “We’re not going to let you out of here! We’ve got 20 guys over here and you don’t have a chance!”

When they don’t fall for our empty threats, we beat a retreat down the corridor and into the room where we found the dead crab. Foot gets some rope out of his backpack and Glenn helps him string it across the entrance at shin level. We think we hear footsteps but then nothing but silence.

After a few minutes of waiting and debating, we strike out into the unexplored tunnel, where we eventually meet a room full of crabs! These crabs seem cold and evil. Let’s go back the way we came!

Back in the square room, we head down the hole. This room has been excavated, this dig site. At the bottom of the pit we find an ancient archway that has a Crabby vibe. We go through. We find a crab body wrapped in spiderwebs.

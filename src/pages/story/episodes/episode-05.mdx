## Session 5 - 11/23/20

The group is peering into the darkness at the end of our creepy crab pit. We can see a Chamber in front of us with an opening at the end. Foot throws a fire beetle nodule into the chamber. It rolls almost to a stop, before something descends from the ceiling. A Folk-sized spider seems to be testing whether the nodule is edible, then it skitters away leaving the nodule spinning on the dirty floor. We see cobwebs all about and other detritus. The room must be bigger than the chamber we were in before.

Once the spider was out of the direct beetle-light, it easily blended into the rest of the scenery and was very difficult to spot.

Foot lights a torch and takes a step into the hallway, with the rest of the party at his heels. We see more crab-themed art painted on the ground.

With an eye towards the ceiling, the party proceeds forward with Foot at the front. Glenn makes a little light-hearted conversation with Sergio about his fondness for all creatures - but it’s apparent that nobody is really vibing with the spiders. We can barely see the ceiling as Foot thrusts his torch upwards, but we keep seeing unnerving skittering movements at the edge of our vision.

“I’m really fine fighting the people - but …” Wilandra argues. Foot’s bravery propels the group forward and we begin to trace around the perimeter of the room. It’s not long before we locate another door. And across from it another passageway. Foot starts walking down the hallway.

Wilandra is the first to notice a spider falling down on Renske, its horrifying mandibles mangling her neck. She screams out in agony, her body spasming from the venom that courses into her from the gruesome wound. Her feeble attempt to hit back has little impact. Wilandra jumps into action to attack the spider that was on Renske, but her attempt fails. Pipo cowers behind her.

Glenn sees that not only is there a spider that jumped on Renske, but there’s another spider down on the ground scurrying towards her. He hits the spider on Renske, a direct hit on the back. It hisses loudly as it releases from Renske, while ichor bleeds out from its sword wound.

Spider Battle!

Wilandra takes a croquet style swing at the oncoming spider, lopping off one leg which slows down the spider. But the spider continues in its path of attack towards Renske.

Foot lunges forward with his two handed sword towards the spider in front of him, but misses. Renske flails ineffectively at the spider. Sergio follows Foot’s example, runs up to try to skewer the spider on Renske’s back, but fails to damage him. Renske is damaged, but stabilized, but poisoned, and the spider is still on her. But because she’s a Grevling she’s not poisoned! She is unconscious.

Glenn smashes the second spider. Now both spiders are leaking ichor and missing legs.

Foot is almost knocked unconscious by the second spider, but he’s not dead or actually unconscious. Sergio is also wounded by a spider.

Wilandra attacks the spider nearest to herself, but she has to dodge around Pipo, and it was challenging. Meanwhile Sergio “panic stabs” the spider right in the face and then it twitches a bunch and stops moving. Foot is angry and will do his best to destroy the second spider. With both hands on his sword, the pain of his spider bite is too much to bear and he misses. Pipo, encouraged by Wilandra’s efforts to help him, gathers his determination and strikes out at the last living spider. While the hit connects solidly, it does just enough damage to do the spider in.

As we catch our breath, we see 2 more spiders watching from afar. They appear to be guarding whatever entrances are over there. While Renske comes to, the group rallies in the lower dig site to recuperate and have a meal.

People have rested and healed somewhat, Wilandra has been watching the entrance to the hole and we’re noticing that guards are coming by every 10 minutes on a routine patrol.

“Let’s mosey,” Sergio suggests as the group climbs up the ladder back to the main cave network. We make it to the cave entrance where a rowboat is still waiting. It’s going to be tight fitting all 6 of us into the rowboat but we think we can manage it. Wilandra determines that the boat is well constructed, and we board. Just as we’re about to disembark we hear noises. A group of people are running down the hallway. Wilandra uses her pole to push off, barking harshly “Row! Row!” while Sergio and Glenn paddle the rowboat. If anybody comes too near in the water, Wilandra will try to whack them with the pole. Then she’s hit in the head by a rock from a sling as one of the creatures on the shore takes aim.

The boat is then out of range of shore attacks. But as we’re coming around the cove our boat strikes against a rocky outcropping which causes a leak the hull. We estimate we can make it 50 yards more. “Start bailing!” Glenn wails at Pipo while Foot shoves his backpack into the hole. Foot grabs the iron pot to start bailing while Pipo holds Foot’s backpack down to keep the leak minimized as possible.

We row our boat ashore onto a stand of beach. Sergio starts to construct a travois out of the oars and other material to help transport Renske back to Poe village. We will have to return to Poe village eventually so why not now? Wilandra feels extremely confident in her ability to patch the boat. The mirror sea is really living up to its name on this sunny, windless day. The group decides to take the time to fix up the boat and use that to make our way back to Poe Village.

It takes Wilandra but 20 minutes to patch up the boat. Everything about her being from a family of boatmakers seems to be true. She delivers results. We make our way back to Poe around nightfall. Coralea sees Pipo right away, and we learn that they are siblings. Wilandra steps forward to ensure Coralea that we are only aiding poor little Pipo.

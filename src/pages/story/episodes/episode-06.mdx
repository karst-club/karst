## Session 6 - 1/11/21

Foot makes a heroic pose at the front of the boat.

Coralea goes to find Da’an to administer healing to Renske. Da’an is nowhere to be found so we leave Pipo with his sister and get back in the boat. We row back to the sandbar and knock on the Hermit’s front door.

We think it’s odd that the Hermit’s house is built on a sandbar, but Glenn and Foot both hop forward to knock on the door. After a spell, an ancient Veldling answers “May I help you?” in a creaky squeaky voice.
Glenn drawls, “We’re new here and we’ve got this pal who got wrecked by a spider. Can you heal her?” He sounds very matter of fact and unmoved.
The old veldling waves a decrepit paw and parts the two froggy callers who step aside, making his way down to the beach. The old one waves his arms over Renske, causing her body to raise into the air and hover in mid air! To the group’s astonishment she levitates into the front door and out of sight. “Come back tomorrow” the Old One says, “She will be fine.”

Wilandra seems very worried for the other Grevling. “Did you see how stiff she went? This is not good.” But Sergio stands up for the sage old Velding, and seems impressed by their demonstrated skills. Wilandra quips back that he can go back to his crystals and star charts.
Foot offers a different perspective. “If Renske is dead, it was the will of Woggles. She will metamorphose to her next phase of life as part of the Great Design.” Glenn makes circles in the sand with his big sticky toe pad, not having anything to say. He lets a quiet rumbling croak fill the silence instead of trying to make words, his neck puffing up with a shudder.

Glenn feels a chill through his slimy warty skin, and reaches for his fire starting tools, where he’s quickly assisted by Foot. “I hope this fire helps deter zombies and beetles tonight,” Foot remarks.

Glenn lends his fishing rod to Foot, but he doesn’t catch anything. They pass the night peacefully.

The next morning, the Hermit is sitting outside and Renske is there. She seems unharmed.

Foot starts a conversation with the hermit. “Friend, what deity lends you the powers to perform such miracles of healing and levitation?”
“I just listen to the wind,” says the old man.
Sergio asks his name but he says he doesn’t have one.

Renske seems totally normal but Wilandra and Glenn aren’t sure.

We’ve arranged an agreement with Wim and the other ship builders to repair the ship on the northern shore as long as we’ll keep quiet about it. In the meantime we head back to the cave.

The group quickly made their way back into the upper level of the cave, finding no sign of cultists or any Folk. It seemed as if they had taken their weapons and armor and abandoned their station.

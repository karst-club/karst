## Session 3 - 10/5/20

Foot speaking about Woggles to the carapacerea folks. The hunters send him over to Daan Crabenbos who might care more about Woggles.

Foot mentions the group’s exploits with Zombies to Daan. Daan comments that a sorcerer came to the island seeking great powers and disappeared in the woods. Shortly after, youths started disappearing at the lighthouse. DUN DUN DUN.

Foot also mentions the Crystal Crab Statues to Daan. Daan doesn’t believe that they moved. Foot motions for a private conversation and Daan follows. Foot tells a more detailed version of the battle story and shows Daan the crystal heart. Daan inspects the crystal heart, somewhat awestruck, and mentions that there are at least 10 statues on the island. Daan says there are deity statues on the hill as well, and they predate the island’s inhabitation. Says to ask other folks about where the crystal statues are.

Bar patrons mention an old hermit who lives out past the beach where we washed up. Someone says be careful in the palms on the way to the hermit’s place! Beetles live there.

Maximo (lagartos) - shipbuilder, chip on his shoulder against the fisherman, sympathetic to the farmers, but would also like more clout himself. Says Wim is the one in charge of prices, prices will be higher

Quill island, the island of pines and tears. The Lucio family fled from this island.

<hr>


In the middle of the night, Foot comes awake and notices someone running away from camp, seems like they robbed us! Foot yells out and gives chase!

The thief is caught thanks to an epic shield throw, and they confess that Daan put them up to stealing the crystal heart!!!

The thief spills the beans that there is a secret order that controls the island, Daan numbers among them. “Daan found something in the caves… a source of power!” The thief tells us the Caves are in the palms, and there is a secret water entrance somewhere too. “Daan says you stole the crystal from the island!”

Foot threatens the thief to not tell on them and report any new developments.

The thief goes to “report” to Daan, but comes back and says Daan never showed.

Group decides to check out temple on the hill, Wilandra sneaky scouts ahead of the group. Wilandra checks out a shack thingy on the premises, it looks like it was cleared out recently. There are a few scrolls left, one has directions on how to sail into the water entrance of the cave, one is a prayer, also there are 3 potions (2 green, 1 yellow).

In the morning, we decide to go look for the caves in the Palms. Sergio takes a quick look at the potions, thinks the green ones are probably healing potions, not sure about the yellow…

After a quick jaunt through town, we head into the palms to the NW. We spot some beetles in the distance. While searching, Foot and Glenn hear crashing noises in the trees. A Grevling who looks very worse for wear comes out of the brush, she looks at us with crazy eyes and a cutlass in her hand. Glenn yells out to back off!!! The Grevling drops her sword and calms a bit, “Who are you?!?!” she asks. Glenn hands over his canteen and the Grevling explains she is part of an expedition that landed here some months ago. The expedition leader was searching for some kind of power source. Grevling got lost in the woods and has been barely surviving. After some more food and talk, she reveals that she knows where the Caves are. Her name is Renske.

We traipse through the palms for another hour until we reach the entrance to the Caves. Torches are distributed and we squeeze into the cave. There is a wide chamber with another passageway at the end.

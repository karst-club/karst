## Session 2 - 9/7/20

After the zombie fight: Sergio reads the Pirate Journal, Wilandra wonders about warning the Village

Glenn wants to fight some more beetles, and agrees we should head towards the cove.

Group decides to look for the cove mentioned in the Pirate Journal.

We arrive at a rocky outcrop where a cove can be viewed about 1 mile down coast, in the early afternoon. A large stomach rumble reminds everyone that itâ€™s lunch time.

Any signs of beetles? We also notice other recent shoe tracks made by Folk. They look to be heading inland.

Group decides to cautiously mount the hillside to get a direct view on the cove, where they can view a shipwreck just offshore. There are figures that appear to be made of crystal, apparently 1.5x the size of a Folk, standing still near the beach. We also notice some camouflaged figures moving around on the hillside opposite the cove to our current hillside. We suggest they may be Tiger Beetles based on what weâ€™ve learned so far. They donâ€™t have glowing nodules.

Foot plans to swim to the boat. Foot and Sergio make their way down to the shore. These statues donâ€™t look like any Folk that weâ€™ve ever seen. Glenn stays on the shoreline with all the gear and plays lookout while the other 3 swim for the shipwreck.

At least 4 or 5 planks that would need to be replaced to make the ship seaworthy. Not unfixable though, would need at least 8 people to pull it out.

Group discusses various plans for getting off the island. The idea is to pay the locals to help us fix up the ship. While Foot and Wilandra debate the merits of selling the Quartz statues, Sergio grabs a handful of food and starts to approach the gang of tiger beetles sunning themselves on the nearby dock.

These beetles are really big! Big enough to ride on. There are 8 of them on and around the dock. One skitters closer to Sergio to take a bite of food, regarding him. Sergio, feeling uncomfortable in the way heâ€™s being regarded as a potential snack, tosses another chunk of food up the hill and it rushed off after the food. They seem very interested in motion and food.

Wilandra examines a quartz statue up close. While not seeming magical to her, per se, they are aesthetically creepy. They look like Crab-Folk and they have a red heart inside the clear quartz of their chest. She touches one. As she continues to inspect the statue she notices that each statue has a path of footprints leading to its position on the beach, as though it had frozen in place.

Glenn challenges whether it could really be part of Woggles plan for us to make money off of these statues, and urges the group to return to the mission of glowing nodule beetles.

### Battle time! Vs. Crystal Statues

Foot threw a rock at the statue. It woke up and started walking towards us. Sergio stabs, taking a small chunk out of the quartz, ending his turn by hiding behind Foot. The statue claws out at Foot, raking his armor and startling him into a swing of his sword.

Glenn focuses all his ability into a running forward shield charge, but misses his target by a wide margin and ends up stumbling dizzily at the waterâ€™s edge with no target in sight. A crab statue attempts to connect with the fast moving Glenn but misses.

Wilandra stabs a crab statue in the back to little apparent effect, except the statue whirling around to strike back, knocking the wind out of her.

Glenn, his back to the terribly fearsome ocean feels caught in fearâ€™s grip. His eye focuses towards the glowing gem inside the Crystal Crabâ€™s chest. With finally truer aim, he lunges forward for a piercing attack directly at the heart, to satisfying cracks as the statue staggers backward in response to his damaging strike.

Beetles are watching, noticing the action and paying attention to the movement. Could the beetles be enticed towards attacking the Crystal Crabs? Sergio considers that we Folk would probably be more food-like to the beetles compared to the crystal monsters.

Foot downs a statue! Glenn & Sergio combo kill another statue!

Tiger Beetles are advancing, so we distract them with food and run away!

### AFTER THE BATTLEâ€¦

Sergio tries to heal Wilandra with a spell, Wilandra resists it, yells to keep that Magic stuff away from her, and Sergio is confused.

We make our way back to town.

Van Zeligans - Heard about the privateers, Wim is the son, head ship builder. He never heard of Crab things on the Island before. Heâ€™s heard of the statues and says folks know to stay away from them.

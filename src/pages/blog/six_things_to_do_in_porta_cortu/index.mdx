> Six neighborhoods, six hooks each. Welcome to the biggest little city in Karst.

Porta Cortu is a loosely organized collection of communities spread across four small and densely populated islands. It’s a nexus for merchants, adventurers, and excitement, and is definitely deserving of its own full publication someday. For now though, it’s the perfect subject for a series of blog posts.

The three major islands of Porta Cortu are made up of a patchwork of small districts, boroughs, neighborhood councils, and petty fiefdoms, ranging in size from a single city block to a full quarter of one of the islands. Each post will explore one of these neighborhoods, highlighting the different facets of one of the most iconic jewels of the Karst Archipelago.

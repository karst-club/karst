> Claims to be a satellite school of the famed University of Gresterecht. Probably isn't.

Its dubious heritage aside, the University at Whitecliff is one of the foremost centers of knowledge in the Karst Archipelago. It offers classes in many disciplines and schools of thought but the University is known primarily for its School of Sorcery, where the magical art of Thaumaturgy is studied, as well as its History Department, second to none in the Mirror Sea.

Many members of the Sorcerers Union work for the University, either directly as professors and staff, or indirectly as adjunct tutors, independent researchers, or “procurers” of magical ingredients. Still, the Sorcerers Union remains an independent organization, with chapters and members in far flung locales. Most students of the School of Sorcery join the Union upon graduation, bringing its rites and practices wherever their post-collegiate life takes them.

The campus is comprised of a handful of old stone buildings encircled and connected by a towering stone wall. The Whitecliff Observatory, the highest point on the island, and the Hammerton Library and Collection of Antiquities, being famous in their own right, are the two most visited buildings inside the University.

Surrounding the walls of the University is a collection of tightly-packed yet surprisingly spacious houses filled with students, faculty, and staff, along with a few suppliers and purveyors of magical and non-magical goods.

The University at Whitecliff and its surroundings are overseen by the Chancellor and Board of Regents. The Board claims to have a one thousand and one year lease on the land beneath the campus, which no one has ever seriously tried to dispute. Perhaps as a gesture, the Regents send an advisor to the Trifecta rather than a proper Trifect. This advisor has no voting power but serves as council to the Trifects on all subjects scientific, magical, historical, or otherwise learned.

## Six things to do around the University at Whitecliff

1. Solve a theoretical dispute between two adjunct Thaumaturges of the Sorcerers Union.
2. Go fetch some magical item that a history professor wants to use as a prop for a lecture. Obviously located in an incredibly dangerous or inconvenient location, like a forgotten temple from the First Serpos Empire or something. Minor details.
3. Find a few bundles, pieces, or pinches of a magical ingredient that a professor of Thaumaturgy needs for an experiment. Not so obviously located in a dangerous AND inconvenient location under specific conditions, like the ancient battlefield of Scatterbones, at night, on the equinox. Of course.
4. A magical experiment has gone wrong and is threatening to burn down the university and half the island, again.
5. Some thieves based out of Drakt Harbor are trying to steal a notorious book or relic from the Hammerton Library. Help them or foil them.
6. The Sorcerers Union is having a row with a group of Thaumaturges out on Orway and unassuming folk keep getting caught up in it. Folk like you.

The Back Quarter is the largest district in Porta Cortu. It encompasses, as the name might suggest, a full quarter of the island of Little Hen. It is also among the least populous districts, home to far more fowl than folk.

As one of two large open spaces in Porta Cortu, the Quarter is a major source of food for the rest of Porta Cortu, particularly fresh and preserved fruits, as well as fowl and eggs.

Jam and other preserves are a specialty of the Back Quarter, sold mostly to crews with long sea voyages ahead of them. The hennery and goose ranch, on the other hand, raise much of Porta Cortu's meat supply in the form of geese and semi-domesticated islefowl. Joining the two traditions of preservation and fowl-rearing, the Back Quarter’s most acclaimed export is potted goose, a dish sought far and wide across the archipelago.

The scenery is comprised of orchards, bird yards, farm houses, and windmills. A literal breath of fresh air from the rest of Porta Cortu, a crisp breeze blows through these parts. Recently, a number of sinkholes and cave-ins have opened up in the orchards. Rumors swirl that the entrance to a network of artificial caves was discovered inside of one.

There is something odd and decidedly sinister about the Back Quarter. No one can quite put their finger on it, but the feeling is palpable and unmistakable, at least to outsiders. Long time residents and natives of the Back Quarter react with what seems to be genuine surprise at any notion that their home is something other than idyllic and pastoral.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Back Quarter is almost entirely native-born. Those who grew up in the Quarter usually stay in the Quarter and very few outsiders are ever struck with the desire to move there. This is unique among the districts of Porta Cortu, running counter to the constant sense of change felt elsewhere and giving the Back Quarter an almost timeless feel in contrast.

The Quarter is governed by the Benevolent Council of Elders, a group whose full membership is unclear, but is widely assumed by outsiders to be exactly as described.

## Six things to do in the Back Quarter

1. Track down whatever's been plucking off the geese at night and put an end to it. 500¢ reward.
2. A bunch of fruit trees ripened earlier than expected. Help pick the fruit before wild birds and the geese get to them, a race against time.
3. Watch the grass grow.
4. Wake up in a cold sweat with the distinct feeling that you are being watched.
5. Investigate a newly formed sinkhole out in the orchards.
6. Help a farmer transport livestock or produce down to the docks for sale to a mysterious foreign buyer. No questions asked.

> A little _too_ peaceful

The Back Quarter is the largest district in Porta Cortu. It encompasses, as the name might suggest, a full quarter of the island of Little Hen. It is also among the least populous districts, home to many more fowl than folk.

As one of the only two large open spaces in Porta Cortu, the Quarter is one of Porta Cortu's main sources of food, particularly fresh fruits, preserves, and fowl, both meat and eggs.

Jam and other preserves are a specialty here and are sought throughout the Archipelago. The hennery and goose ranch raise much of Porta Cortu's meat supply in the form of semi domesticated islefowl and geese. Joining the traditions of preserves and fowl-rearing, the Back Quarter’s most acclaimed export is potted goose.

The scenery is made up of orchards, bird yards, farm houses, and windmills. A literal breath of fresh air from the rest of the freeport, a crisp breeze blows through these parts. Recently, a number of sinkholes and cave-ins have opened up and rumors persist of a network of caves having been been discovered.

There is something odd and decidedly sinister about the Back Quarter. No one can quite put their finger on it, but the feeling is palpable and unmistakable, at least to outsiders. Long time residents and natives of the Back Quarter show what seems to be genuine surprise at the notion that their home is anything but idyllic and pastoral.

Unsurprisingly, the Back Quarter has a very larges percentage of natives. Those who were born there usually stay there and very few outsiders are ever struck with the desire to move to there. This is unique among the districts of Porta Cortu, running counter to the constant sense of change felt elsewhere and giving the Back Quarter an almost timeless feel in contrast.

The Quarter is governed by the Benevolent Council of Elders, a group whose full membership is unclear, but is widely assumed by outsiders to be exactly as described.

## Six things to do in the Back Quarter

1. Track down whatever's been plucking off geese at night and put an end to it. 500¢ reward.
2. A bunch of fruit trees ripened a few days early. Help pick the fruit before wild birds and the geese get to them, a race against time.
3. Watch the grass grow.
4. Wake up in a cold sweat with the distinct feeling that you are being watched.
5. Investigate a newly formed sinkhole out in the orchards.
6. Help a farmer transport livestock or produce down to the docks for sale to a mysterious foreign buyer, no questions asked.

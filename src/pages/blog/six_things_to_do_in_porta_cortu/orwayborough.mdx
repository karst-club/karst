> “Sky Juice, 2¢ a bottle!”

Orwayborough is one of the dozen or so unofficial territories that make up the Free Island of Orway. Like the other territories on the island, it recognizes itself as the one true governing body of Orway and does not recognize the others as existing at all. In Orwayborough’s case, however, the term “governing body” may be something of a stretch.

Orwayborough is a haphazard and drunken place, even by the island’s notoriously low standards. Residents will proudly, and correctly, inform you that no one is in charge here, and it shows. The cobbled streets and small stretches of coastline that make up the borough are littered with detritus, vomit, and half-conscious drunks.

So proud of their independence are the citizens of Orwayborough, that they have never once attempted to send even an observer to the Trifecta, let alone a proper Trifect, lest they acknowledge its existence and authority at all. In return, the Trifecta, and just about everyone else in Porta Cortu, ignores, or tries to ignore, Orwayborough and the problems it creates for itself.

The closest thing to a local authority are the four taverns of Orwayborough, who not only have the coin to make the occasional improvement, but have an incentive to do so. They keep the place just livable and safe enough that they can continue to operate and turn a profit.

Orwayborough's primary antagonist, and the target of much of its citizens' ire, is the neighboring Grand Duchy of Orway and its ruler, the self-styled Grand Duke of Orway.

Orwayborough is one of the dozen or so unofficial territories of the Free Island of Orway. Like the other territories on the island, it recognizes itself as the one true governing body of Orway and does not recognize the others as existing at all. In Orwayborough’s case, however, the term “governing body” may be something of a stretch.

Orwayborough is a haphazard and drunken place, even by the island’s notoriously low standards. Residents will proudly, and correctly, inform you that no one is in charge of the place, and it shows. The cobbled streets and small bit of coastline that make up the borough are littered with detritus, vomit, and half-conscious drunks.

So proud of their independence are the citizens of Orwayborough, that they have never once attempted to send as much as an observer to the Trifecta, let alone a proper Trifect, lest they acknowledge its existence at all. In return, the Trifecta, and just about everyone else in Porta Cortu, ignores, or tries to ignore, Orwayborough and the problems it creates for itself.

The closest thing to a local authority are the four taverns of Orwayborough, who not only have enough coin to make the occasional improvement, but have the incentive to do so to, in order to keep the place livable enough that they can continue to turn a coin. 

Orwayborough's primary antagonist, and the target of much of its citizens' ire, is the neighboring Grand Duchy of Orway and its ruler, the self-styled Grand Duke of Orway.

Six things to do in Orwayborough:

1. Get serenaded by drunken musicians at all hours of the day and night
2. Get involved with a plot to overthrow the Grand Duke of Orway
3. Drink too much Sky Jucie
4. Accidentally burn half the island down, again
5. Conspire with the owner of one tavern to sabotage their rival's stills
6. Discover what has been causing folk to disappear near the well at night

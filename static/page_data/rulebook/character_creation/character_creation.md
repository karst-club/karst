Before the game can start, the Players must create Player Characters. This is a simple process that takes a little time, a pencil, and a piece of paper or something fancier, like a character sheet.

## Base Stats

### Species

Start by selecting a Species for your Character. You can do this by simply choosing the species you would like to play or by rolling 1d6 to randomly select one. Turn to the next section to learn more about the species, their histories, cultures, and abilities. Once you've selected a species write it down along with the special abilities it grants you.

### Attributes

Your attributes are generated in an arbitrary and capricious manner, as is tradition. However, you are given one bit of mercy. Roll 4d6 and drop the lowest value seven times and then assign six of the roll to your six attributes as you choose.

### Level

Player Characters start at Level 1 with 0 XP. Write both of these things down.

### HP

Starting characters get two hit dice worth of HP. Roll 2d6 each modified by Con to generate HP. All characters start with at least 2 HP.

### Loot

Roll 3d6 and multiply the result by 10 for your starting Loot. The values of these 3 dice may also me used to randomly generate a background using the link below if you would like inspiration.

## Interlude

At this point you are ready to develop this collection of stats into an actual Character. There are a few ways of doing this:

- Come up with a concept or Hook for your Character and then choose Knacks and Equipment based on it.
- Look through the list of Knacks and choose those that appeal to you or fit your characterâ€™s abilities, purchase equipment and then develop a backstory based on your choices.
- Some combination of both methods.

The instructions that follow assume the second choice.

## Fleshing Things Out

It's time to choose what your character is talented at and what kind of items they have.

### Knacks

Choose three starting Knacks and write them down. You can not choose the same Knack twice, even though you are technically purchasing two levels' worth of them (0 and 1). If your Knacks grant you spells, write those down too.

### Weapons, Armor, Equipment & Gear

Purchase Weapons to wield, Armor to wear, and Equipment & Gear to use and consume on your adventures. Some Items can only be used if you have the right Knack. Other Knacks might require you to have a specific item or increase your abilities with certain categories of Items. Keep these facts in mind as you select your starting Items. 

For each item that you purchase, jot down one or two words describing it.

## Finishing Touches

Now that you have your stats, Knacks, and starting equipment you should be able to fill out the rest of your character sheet. 

### Derived Stats

There are a number of important stats and values that you can now write down. 

Your AC starts at 10 and goes up based on your Dex bonus, the Armor you are wearing, and specific Knacks.

Your movement rate starts at 120', going down to 90' if you wear armor, and 60' if you wear heavy armor. Carrying treasure or anything heavy further reduces your movement by 30'.

Write down the damage values for any weapons you anticipate using as well as any attack bonuses you might have.

### Hook & Name

Jot down a Hook for your Character. This should be a sentence or less that sums them up. No need to get too fancy here.

Finally, come up with a Name. Now, your Character is ready to play.

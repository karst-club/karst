Karst is played as a shared dialog between the Players and the Narrator. These rules provide a framework for how that dialog is conducted and how situations with multiple outcomes can be resolved using creativity, character statistics, and chance.

# Scenes and Actions
The game is mostly comprised of Scenes. 

The Narrator starts a Scene by describing the situation to the Players. Next, the Players ask the Narrator any questions they might have about the scene before stating any Actions their Characters are taking. The Narrator answers questions and describes the outcomes of Character Actions, noting how the Scene has changed.

This dialog continues back and forth until the Scene reaches a conclusion, transitioning to another Scene or ending the current Episode.

## Actions
When a Player wants their Character to do something, they say so. This is an Action.

When a Player declares an Action, it generally happens. The Narrator describes the result or invites the Player to do so.

Sometimes, the Narrator will determine that the Character has failed or is unable to perform the Action and will describe the result of the failure.

### Rolling for Success

When there is doubt about whether or not a Player's Character would succeed at an Action, or in situations where an Action's success or failure would be an interesting outcome, the Narrator may have the Player roll to determine how their Character fares. 

The Player rolls 1d6. If the roll is a 6, the Character succeeds at their Action. If the roll is a 1, the Character fails. For any other result, the Player applies any relevant modifiers, succeeeding if the modified result is 6 or higher.

Actions are generally based on and modified by an Attribute. Many Knacks, Abilities, and Items can modify Action rolls too, tipping the scale for or against Characters.

When the outcome of an Action would not be immediately apparent to the Character, the Narrator may roll in secret, revealing the result when appropriate.

The last thing about rolling for success, is that it should happen infrequently. Players are meant to be rewarded for their creativity, Characters are capable of more than just the things on their sheets, and rolls shouldn't be made just for the sake of rolling dice. Limiting Action rolls to the big moments in a game can also make them really memorable. On the other hand, it is your game, and all this is just my opinion. If you like rolling dice for every Action, go for it. Karst is here for your fun, not its fun.

## Saving Throws

When Actions and other events might cause Bad Things to happen to a Character, they will sometimes have the chance to make a Saving Throw to try and minimize or avoid the effects.

There are four types of Saving Throws: 

- Poison/Death
- Petrify/Paralysis
- Elements
- Magic

To make a Saving Throw, the Player rolls a d20 and adds 1 for every even-numbered Level their Character has reached, as well as any other modifiers including Wis for Magic Saving Throws and Con for all others. If the score is equal to or higher than 15, they have successfully Saved, mitigating or minimizing the effects.

# Encounters and Combat

Scenes are generally a free-flowing discussion, but if a confrontation between two or more groups arises, the Scene becomes an Encounter.

Encounters occur over a number of Rounds. During a Round, each Character is given a Turn to act. In the game world, a Round ususally represents a handful seconds, but their length can be varied to better fit the pacing of an Encounter.

## Surprise

If there is a chance either side could be Surprised about the Encounter, each Player rolls a d6 before the first round to determine if their Character is Surprised or not. On a roll of a 1 or 2 the Character is surprised and cannot act in the first Round.

## Initiative

Characters who are not surprised roll a d6 modified by Dex to generate their Initiative score. Participants take their Turns in order of Initiative from highest score to lowest, with PCs winning ties against NPCs and resolving ties amongst themselves as they see fit.

## Character Turns

On their Turn a Character may Move and take an Action. Certain Actions may require the Character to remain stationary or may be Sustained across multiple Turns.

If a Character is Encumbered during an Encounter, their movement is halved, their AC is reduced by 2, and they lose any positive Dex modifiers.

There are two special types of Actions that Characters often perform during Encounters, Talking with the other side and Attacking them.

## Talking

Characters may spend their Action attempting to talk and perhaps reason, bargain, or parlay with the other side. The first time a Player Character does this during an encounter, they get to make a Reaction roll as an Action modified by Cha. The higher the number the less negative the reaction.

## Attacking and Combat

When talking won’t do, Characters can attack. If a Character makes an Attack during an Encounter it becomes a Combat.

Attacks are made by rolling a d20 modified by Str for melee or Dex for ranged attacks. Other modifiers may apply, such as +2 for sneak attacks made on unsuspecting targets. If the roll is equal to or over the opponent’s AC, the Character hits and does Damage.

### Damage

A successful Attack does at least 1 Damage to an opponent's HP. The Attacker rolls their weapon's Damage. Melee Attack Damage is modified by Str.

## End of Round

After all Characters have had their Turn, the Narrator determines what happens next.

### Morale Checks

If a group of Non-Player Characters has taken their first casualty or lost half of their members, they need to make a morale check. This is done by rolling 2d6 and comparing it against their morale score. A failed morale check results in the group surrendering or fleeing.

### Ending an Encounter

If one side has been defeated or tensions have been de-escalated, the Encounter ends. Otherwise, another round begins, starting with the roll for Initiative.

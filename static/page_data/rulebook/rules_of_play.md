Karst is played as a shared dialog between the Players and the Referee. These rules provide a framework for how that dialog is conducted and how situations with multiple outcomes can be resolved using creativity, character statistics, and chance.

# Scenes and Actions
The game is mostly comprised of Scenes. 

The Referee starts a Scene by describing the situation to the Players. Next, the Players ask the Referee questions any questions they might have about the scene before stating any Actions their Characters are taking. The Referee answers questions and describes the outcomes of Character Actions, noting how the Scene has changed.

This dialog continues back and forth until the Scene reaches a conclusion, transitioning to another Scene or ending the current Episode.

## Actions
When a Player wants their Character to do something, they say so. This is an Action.

When a Player declares an Action, it generally happens. The Referee describes the result or invites the Player to do so.

Sometimes, the Referee will determine that the Character has failed or is unable to perform the Action and will describe the result of the failure.

### Rolling for Success

When there is doubt about whether or not a PC would succeed at an Action, or if success and failure are both interesting outcomes, the Referee may set odds and have the Player roll a d6 to determine what happens. 

Actions based on Attributes are modified by them. Modifiers may never bring the odds below 1 in 6 and if the odds are modified to 6 in 6 or higher, success should be automatic or failure should only occur on a roll of 12 on 2d6 (1 in 36 odds).

When the outcome would not be immediately apparent to the Character, the Referee may roll in secret instead.

The last and most important thing about rolling for success is that it should happen infrequently.

## Saving Throws

When Actions and other events might cause Bad Things to happen to a Character, they will sometimes have the chance to make a Saving Throw to try and minimize or avoid the effects.

The character rolls a d20 and adds 1 for every even-numbered level they have reached, as well as any other modifiers. If the score is equal to or higher than 15, they have successfully Saved. (15|16 for Poison/Petrify, 18|20 for Elements/Magic?)

There are four types of Saving Throws: 

- Poison/Death
- Petrify/Paralysis
- Elements
- Magic

Magic Saving Throws are modified by a Character's Wis.

# Encounters and Combat

Scenes are generally a free-flowing discussion, but if a confrontation between two parties arises, the Scene becomes an Encounter.

Encounters occur over a number of Rounds. Within each round, Characters are given an opportunity to act.

## Surprise

If there is a chance either side could be Surprised about the Encounter, everyone rolls a d6 before the first round to determine if they are. On a roll of a 1 or 2 a character is surprised and cannot act in the first round.

## Initiative

Characters who are not surprised roll a d6 modified by Dex to generate their Initiative score. Participants act in order of Initiative from highest score to lowest, with PCs winning ties against NPCs and resolving ties amongst themselves as they see fit.

## Character Turns

On their turn a Character may Move and take an Action.

If a Character is Encumbered during an Encounter, their movement is halved, their AC is reduced by 1, and they lose any positive Dex modifiers.

There are two special types of Actions that Characters often perform during Encounters, Talking with the other side and Attacking them.

## Talking

Characters may spend their Action attempting to talk and perhaps reason, bargain, or parlay with the other side. The first time a Player Character does this during an encounter, they get to make a Reaction roll using 2d6 modified by Cha. The higher the number the less negative the reaction.

## Attacking and Combat

When talking won’t do, Characters can attack. If a Character makes an Attack during an Encounter it becomes a Combat.

Attacks are made by rolling a d20 modified by Str for melee or Dex for ranged attacks. Other modifiers may apply, such as +2 for sneak attacks made on unsuspecting targets. If the roll is equal to or over the opponent’s AC, the Characters hits and does Damage.

### Damage

A successful Attack does at least 1 Damage to an opponent's HP. The Attacker rolls based on their weapon's Damage. Melee Attack Damage is modified by Str.

## End of Round

After all Characters have had their turn, the Referee determines what happens next.

### Morale Checks

If a group of Non-Player Characters has taken their first casualty or lost half of their members, they need to make a morale check. This is done by rolling 2d6 and comparing it against their morale score. A failed morale check results in the group surrendering or fleeing.

### Ending an Encounter

If one side has been defeated or tensions have been de-escalated, the Encounter ends. Otherwise, another round begins, starting with the roll for Initiative.

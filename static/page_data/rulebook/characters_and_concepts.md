These rules govern Player Characters foremost, but also cover **N**on-**P**layer **C**haracters controlled by the Referee.

## Species & Monsters

Karst is a world with multiple sentient Species, or Folk, each with their own traits, cultures, and abilities. All Player Characters belong to one of these Species, as do many NPCs.

Monster is a catch-all term for any NPC that is not one of these Species.

## Attributes

Characters have six attributes:

- **Str**ength - Phyical might
- **Dex**terity - Fine motor coordination and reaction time
- **Con**stitution - Heartiness and heath
- **Int**elligence - Mental acuity
- **Wis**dom - Situational judgement 
- **Cha**risma - Affability and authority

Their value ranges from 3 to 18, determined by a roll of 3d6.

An attribute’s value corresponds to a modifier which ranges from -3 to +3

- **3:** -3
- **4, 5:** -2
- **6, 7, 8:** -1
- **9, 10, 11, 12:** 0
- **13, 14, 15:** +1
- **16, 17:** +2
- **18:** +3

Modifiers affect rolls related to the attribute, reflecting the strengths and weaknesses of Characters.

## Levels and Experience Points (XP)

All characters have a Level, which denotes how Experienced they are. Most NPCs are Level 0, but PCs start at Level 1.

PCs track experience using E**x**perience **P**oints, which are gained from spending loot and vanquishing foes. When a Character gains enough XP, they gain a level and all the bonuses associated with it.

The higher the level of a character, the more hit points they have, the better their saves are, and the more extraordinary things they are capable of doing. These extraordinary things are called Knacks.

## Hit Points (HP)

All Characters have one or more **H**it **P**oints and die if they lose them all.

Food and rest can restore HP back to their original value.

Every time a character gains a level they roll a d6 hit die modified by their Con and add it to their permanent HP.

## Armor Class (AC)

**A**rmor **C**lass represents how hard/difficult it is to hit (and Damage) a Character.

Everyone starts with an AC of 10, modified by Dex.

Armor increases AC but can also slow a Character down.

A shield improves a Character’s AC by 1 but gives them a -2 to-hit modifier.

## Knacks

Knacks are what make Characters special.

Everyone has a Knack for something, starting at Level Zero.

As Characters gain levels, they develop the Knack for more things, developing two Knacks at every odd numbered level and one at every even numbered level.

Aside from more Hit Dice and Saving Throw improvements, Knacks are the only form of character advancement. Want to pick locks, cast more spells, or get better at striking your opponents? Develop the Knack for it.

## Equipment, Weapons, Gear, and Loot

Characters don Armor, wield Weapons, and use Equipment and Gear in their adventures to find and recover Loot. If a Character is obviously carrying too may items or too much weight, they become Encumbered.

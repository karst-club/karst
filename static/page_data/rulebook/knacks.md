Knacks are part of what make individuals different and special.

Everyone has a Knack for something, starting with a singular Knack at Level 0.

You Develop two Knacks for every odd-numbered level you reach and one Knack for every even-numbered level.

Some Knacks May be Developed more than once but only once per level. Some Knacks require other Prerequisite Knacks.

Anyone may develop Basic Knacks but you must reach Level 5 to develop Expert Knacks and Level 10 to develop Master Knacks.

## The Fundamentals

### Focus
Effect: Your Focus grows by 1. 
Note: May be taken once per level.
Level: Basic
Category: The Fundamentals

Many Characters have one or more Focus Points, which are typically purchased as a Knack. These points are used to increase one's prowess during Combat. At the start of each round of Combat, Characters may declare how they are allocating their Focus Points. If no declaration is made, it is assumed that their allocation remains the same. In the interest of fast play, Players should create a default allocation.

By default, characters may allocate their Focus between increasing their To-Hit or their Damage, with each point allocated increasing the respective value by 1 for all rolls. Some Knacks and other Abilities allow Characters to allocate points into other areas, such as improving AC or Initiative.

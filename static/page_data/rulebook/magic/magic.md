The world of Karst is a magical one. Characters can learn to draw power from or harness multiple Forms of magic, each with their own source and powers.

## Forms of Magic

The cosmology of Karst has spawned four distinct types, or Forms, of magic, Thaumaturgy, Theurgy, Spiritualism, and Deceit. A Practitioner of Magic is the term for anyone who has the Knack for one or more of these Forms. Becoming versed in any of these mysteries is possible for any character, but may prove incredibly difficult or involve sacrifice and/or devotion. 

### <Link to="deceit">Deceit</Link>

The most sinister Form of magic, Deceit encompasses the Arts of Illusion and Charm. While not every Practitioner of the Form is evil, the ability to deceive and magically influence the behavior others is a frequent draw for those with ill-intent.

### <Link to="spiritism">Spiritism</Link>

Abjuration, Divination, and the Necromantic Arts are granted by the Spirits Below to Practitioners of this Form. Spiritism is a defensive, restorative, supportive, and divinatory Form, powerful, if indirect.

### <Link to="thaumaturgy">Thaumaturgy</Link>

Thaumaturgy is the fine art of bending the Essence of Existence to one's own Will. Practitioners of this Form wield the fearsome Art of Alteration, capable of making changes to themselves and the world around them.

### <Link to="theurgy">Theurgy</Link>

Channeling and Manifesting the Intent of the Gods Above, the Theurge wields the Arts of Evocation and Conjuration. Powerful (if a bit direct) combat magic, summoned aid, and the Blessings of the Gods are the tools of this magical trade.

## Detecting Magic

Like most other things in the world, if a Character actively attempts to Detect the presence of Magic, they have a base 1 in 6 chance of doing so. This does not apply to spells that have their own conditions for detection, such as many of the spells within the Form of Deceit.

## Spells & Spellcasting

All four types of magic rely on the same system of memorization and casting. 

A Practitioner of magic has a certain number of slots inside of their psychic body in which they can store a memorized spell. No matter how many types of magic one knows, they share the same slots. Once cast, the spell disappears from the mind and the slot is freed. Once per day a spell caster may spend an hour memorizing spells, filling any empty slots and optionally replacing the spells still memorized.

Practitioners of Spiritualism and Theurgy are capable of memorizing any spell within their tradition, but must petition the source of their powers to do so. Those that study Thaumaturgy and Deceit must first learn the spells they cast. For each spell slot Knack chosen, three spells, plus or minus the character's Int modifier, are learned. These spells are often chosen by the DM, but not always. There are also other ways of learning spells.

### Spell Memorization

To memorize a spell of a certain type and level, the memorizer must have the Knack for that type of magic, an empty spell slot to memorize the spell into, and enough additional free slots to cover the Overhead of memorizing the spell. This Overhead is calculated by summing the level of the spell and its level less one.  For example, the overhead of a level 2 spell is 3 (2+1), level 5 is 9 (5+4) and the overhead of a level 1 spell is 1 (1+0).

## Other Expressions of Magic

Certain Knacks, Abilities, or Magic Items may give a Character some kind of Magical Power, generally in the form of a Spell that may be cast some number of times per day (or ever). The rules governing these abilities is generally found where they are described. Many of these powers fall under one of the Forms or Arts of Magic but they do not inherently make their wielder a Practitioner as described above.

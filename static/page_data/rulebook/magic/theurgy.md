A devout Form, Theurgy is expressed through the dual Arts of Evocation and Conjuration.

The Theurge channels the Intent of the Gods Above, manifesting their Will within the world. An often direct Form, Theurgy shines in battle.

# Level 1
## Floating Disc
The Theurge summons an invisble plaform that closely follows the caster at waist height for 2d6 x 10 minutes. The platform is roughly the size of a shield and can hold up to 5000 coins of weight. 

## Magic Missile
The Theurge channels the Will of the Gods into a bolt of pure energy, striking a target for 1d6+1 points damage. For every 5 Spell Slot Knacks the caster has, they gain an additional two missiles which may be used to strike the same or different targets.

## Shield (M)
The Theurge shields themselves with the Will of the Gods. For 20 minutes, the caster's AC becomes 15 against melee attacks and 17 versus missiles.

The Arts of Illusion and Enchantment/Charm comprise the Form of Deceit and all its splendor.

Practitioners of this somewhat sinister Form are capable of twisting others perceptions of the world around them and their very thoughts. Though some use the power of Deceit for good, it is no small wonder that Practice is frowned upon by many.

# Level 1
## Charm Person
The Practicioner targets any one Folk whose face they can clearly see, convincing them that they are fast friends. Assuming they can communicate, the caster may then command the target, within reason. The target is given a chance to save against the effect, both initially and weekly thereafter. Characters of above average Intelligence may attempt to save daily, while those with below average Intelligence may only save monthly. (Maybe change to Wis?)

## Cause Fear
The Practicioner instills an overwhelming sense of fear within a single character whose face they can clearly see, causing them to flee and cower for 20 minutes, unless they save against the effect.

## Remove Fear
With a touch, the Practicioner may remove any natural fear from a single character for 20 minutes. If the target of this spell is suffering from magical fear, they may roll to save against it with a bonus equal to the caster's level.

## Sleep
The Practicioner targets a group of living characters whose faces they can see (240'), causing 2d8 HD worth of them to fall asleep for 4d4 x 10 minutes. 

## Ventriloquism
With this spell, the Practicioner is able to make the sound of their voice come from anywhere within earshot of a loud whisper (60').

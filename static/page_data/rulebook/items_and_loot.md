There are all sorts of Items that Characters can use in their adventures. Some examples are listed below. When purchasing an item be sure to write down a couple of words about what makes it unique.

## Coins, Loot, and Treasure

Characters use Coins to purchase Items. While there are smaller denominations (quarters or even pieces of eight), Characters only deal in a singular denomination, the Coin. 

Characters spend a good deal of their time attemting to find and recover Treasure, generally in the form of Loot and Magical Items. Loot is simply a catch-all term for any sort of Item that is not listed below, particularly Items that are worth something to someone. Magical Items, as the name might imply, are normal items that have been embued with some form of magical power or energy.

These rules govern **P**layer **C**haracters foremost, but also cover **N**on-**P**layer **C**haracters and Monsters controlled by the Narrator.

## Species & Monsters

Karst is a world with multiple sentient Species, or Folk, each with their own traits, cultures, and abilities. All Player Characters belong to one of these Species, as do many NPCs.

Monster is a catch-all term for any NPC that is not a member of the Folk.

## Attributes

Characters have six Attributes:

- **Str**ength - Phyical might
- **Dex**terity - Fine motor coordination and reaction time
- **Con**stitution - Heartiness and heath
- **Int**elligence - Mental acuity
- **Wis**dom - Situational judgement 
- **Cha**risma - Affability and authority

Their values range from 3 to 18.

An Attribute’s value corresponds to a modifier which ranges from -3 to +3:

- **3:** -3
- **4, 5:** -2
- **6, 7, 8:** -1
- **9, 10, 11, 12:** 0
- **13, 14, 15:** +1
- **16, 17:** +2
- **18:** +3

Modifiers affect rolls related to the Attribute, reflecting the strengths and weaknesses of Characters.

## Levels and Experience Points (XP)

All characters have a Level, which denotes how Experienced they are. Most common folk are Level 0, but PCs start the game having reached Level 1.

PCs track experience using E**x**perience **P**oints, which are gained from overcoming foes, spending Coin, or recovering Treasure and Loot. When a Character gains enough XP, they reach the next Level and gain all the bonuses associated with doing so.

The higher the level of a character, the more Hit Points they have, the more likely they are to Save against negative effects, and the more extraordinary things they are capable of doing. These extraordinary things are called Knacks.

## Hit Points (HP)

All Characters have one or more **H**it **P**oints and will die if they lose all of them.

Food and rest can restore HP back to their original value.

Every time a character reaches a new Level, they roll a d6 modified by their Con and add the result to their permanent HP. If the roll is 0 or less, the Character gains 1 HP instead.

## Armor Class (AC)

**A**rmor **C**lass represents how difficult it is to hit a Character. It is a combination of their ability to dodge and the strenght of any armor they may be wearing.

Everyone starts with an AC of 10, modified by Dex.

Armor increases AC but can also slow a Character down.

A shield improves a Character’s AC by 1 but gives them a -2 to-hit attack modifier.

## Knacks

Knacks are what make Characters special.

Everyone has a Knack for something, starting at Level 0.

As Characters gain Levels, they develop the Knack for more things, developing two Knacks at every odd numbered Level and one at every even numbered Level.

Aside from more Hit Points and Saving Throw improvements, Knacks are the only form of Character advancement. Want to pick locks, cast more spells, or get better at striking your opponents? Develop the Knack for it.

## Items

Characters don Armor, wield Weapons, and use Equipment and Gear in their adventures to find and recover Loot and Treasure. All of these things are Items. If a Character is obviously carrying too may Items or too much weight, they become Encumbered and are unable to do anything but walk at one half of their usual speed.

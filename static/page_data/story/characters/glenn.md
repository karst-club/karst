## Backstory
Glenn was brought up in a cultured and prosperous family of Visita embedded in
the mercantile culture of Belagoria.

His naturally dim and brutal nature was one that the people around him found many
useful applications for. He's spent years running traplines and taking care of
other people's dirty work.

Glenn takes pride in his identity as and community with cold-blooded Folk.

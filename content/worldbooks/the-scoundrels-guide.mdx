# The Scoundrel’s Guide to Drakt Harbor

[[Drakt Harbor]] is a great place to come and spend your coin! It has everything a never-do-well could dream of but it is also a good place to get stabbed. That is why I made this guide for clever scoundrels like you who want to make the most out of their time in the Harbor and not get stabbed too.

## What does Drakt Harbor look like?

The folks who started Drakt Harbor probably chose to put it where it is because it’s nice and hidden and not easy to find. The island is a big ugly rock just sticking out of the sea. Up on top is some dirt, but the sides are all cliffs. It looks like a whole lot of nothing but if you sail up to the island just the right way there is a secret cove and Drakt Harbor is inside there. Don’t tell anyone I told you that.

The sky is always a little darker over the Harbor and not just because all the cliffs. One of the old Sorcerers in the caves says it is because of the Spirits that live here but I do not try to stick my nose in Spirit stuff so ask someone else about that if you have to. There is enough trouble and coin with just the living thank you very much. Not that I am scared of Spirits or anything like that.

There is lots of caves in the cliffs and that’s where the first folk who got here started living. Then some other folk took a wrecked ship and turned it into a floating parlor next to the cliff with drinks and dice and before you know it there was a whole Harbor of scoundrels.

Now-a-days the caves are almost full up and they are always digging more but it is slow going so other folk started finding more wrecked boats and wood to build floating parlors and stores and houses and docks and that is how it became Drakt Harbor.

## Where to go to not get stabbed?

Like I said there was the first parlor that some folk made out of a wrecked ship before all the other ones. It's still there but now it is called Craul's Parlor because that is the name of the lagartos who bought it from I don't know who but whoever owned it before Craul bought it. I know you are going to ask me how do I know that it is the first parlor? Well because everyone knows that and Craul even told me so himself so there you go.

Anyways you should go to it because Craul always has the best sky juice and other tasty drinks in the harbor and there is always dice games and because Craul said I would not owe him as much coin if I wrote about how good his parlor is and he would not lie about that so go to Craul's it is good.

## Where can you buy you own knife?

If you want to buy a blade instead of getting stabbed by one there are many shops and all of them will try to swindle you but some more than others. There is a shop called the Rusty Dagger that is out on one of the docks and they will give you probably the best deal for weapons but the name is not just for fun sometimes they have bits of rust or come with blood on them already.

Maybe you are a wealthy scoundrel and want something fancier or also if you need armor that you can sneak around in there is a shop in the caves that is run by a very old serpos who does not talk at all anymore or maybe ever but has the sharpest knives that you can find on the island or anywhere else I bet.

There is also the ones who sell blades and things down in the big market on the docks but you would be very smart not to trust them for pretty much anything other than taking your coin.

## What is in the caves?

What is in the caves you want to know? It is very dark in places and very easy to find a knife in your back so be careful but there is also many fascinating things in there. Inside there is a grotto with a waterfall and that is where some of the most scrupulous folk in Drakt Harbor grow mushrooms. They will still stab you if you try to steal them though. The waterfall gives off a strange light and they say that the mist from it is good for your health but it gives me shivers even when I just think about it.

Deeper in the caves is where the old sorcerers live. For a coin they will tell you your fortune but they will not give it back if you do not like what they say. Even deeper than that is the place where no body goes who wants to come back. If you have read this far you are a better reader than I am a writer and so I will give you my last piece of advice. Do not go down there no matter how much coin anyone says is in it. There are better ways to make a living in Drakt Harbor than falling for that old trick.

title: Magical Traditions
---

The four magical traditions each grant their practitioners spells. Each spell that is known by a practioner may be cast once per day, given enough concentration. For each level of a magical knack that a character develops, they learn the corresponding level of that tradition’s spells.

## Theurgy

When the Gods Above died in creation, their Will became a part of all things—the Essence of Existence. To channel and manifest this Will is known as Theurgy. Faithful and demanding is the path of the Theurge—for devotion is the price that must be paid in exchange for the Miracles they are afforded.

It is harmony that the theurge seeks to find through their devotion. To live in accordance with their chosen gods—and to rid the world of the inharmonious—is their purpose and goal. Harmony aside, the miracles performed by the theurge are not subtle matters. These powers affect change; often in the most violent or direct manner possible.

### Level One - Observance

#### Bolt

Righteous energy.

_Strike one nearby target for six damage._

#### Shield

Will withstands trouble.

_Choose yourself, a nearby character, or an item. The subject gains four defense for the next hour._

### Level Two - Reverence

#### Bless

Faith.

_Choose up to three nearby targets, optionally including yourself. For the next hour the subjects gain two to all attack rolls._

#### Blight

Fury.

_Choose up to six nearby targets. For the next ten minutes they subtract two from their defense and all attack rolls._

### Level Three - Dedication

#### Ball of Fire

Purification through immolation.

_Choose a small area, it erupts in a ball of fire, causing four six-sided dice of damage to any subjects within it._

#### Grace

Harmonious living.

_Choose up to three nearby targets, including yourself. For the next hour they add one to all rolls._

### Level Four - Devotion

#### Fate

Faith rewarded.

_You can cast this spell instantly before you or another character is about to roll the dice. Choose the result, rather than rolling for it._

#### Shift

A sudden change in conditions.

_For the next hour you can change the nearby climate, increasing or decreasing the temperature, humidity, and perspiration._

### Level Five - Sanctity

#### Eradicate

Opposition removed.

_Target one nearby character, immediately reducing their health to negative two._

#### Servant of Will

Belief made manifest.

_Summon a Servant of Will to will follow your command for one hour._

## Thaumaturgy

All that is everything has been woven together into the Essence of Existence; Thaumaturgy is the art and science of its transformation. To understand the nature of this essence—and reshape it to one’s own desires—is the life work of every Thaumaturge, a study that is equal parts research and applied practice.

The great works of Thaumaturgy are known as Transformations. These precise and exacting spells change the very Essence of Existence, often pushing it to one extreme or another. More direct than some forms of magic, there is still a sublime grace to art and science of Thaumaturgy.

While it is claimed that Thaumaturgy was taught to folk by the wind itself, the modern teaching and practice is far more regimented than the other magical traditions. Many a Thaumaturge has undergone a formal course of study at a school or university, or began their career as an apprentice. As a result, there are many competing schools of thought, academic rivalries, and theoretical disputes amongst the thaumaturgical community.

### Level One - The Apprentice

#### Lumination

Light and shadow.

_Target one character, item, or piece of scenery, making it glow brightly or absorb nearby light, illuminating the area nearby or casting it into complete darkness. This effect lasts for one hour. If cast on the eyes of a character, they are blinded for the spell’s duration._

#### Magnetism

Attraction and repulsion.

_Choose two targets, such as characters, items, or scenery. For the next hour they are either fused together or repel each other with great strength._

#### Purity

Time and change.

_You can age or reverse the aging of a dozen meals’ worth of food and drink, making them edible or inedible in the process. This spell can be cast on a similar amount of any other lifeless matter—rotting it or purifying it—including wood._

### Level Two - The Student

#### Levitation

Up and down.

_Target yourself, a willing character, or a nearby item. For the next hour the effects of gravity upon the subject are replaced by your whims. The subject can not be made to rise quicker than a fast walking speed or fall faster than the speed of gravity._

#### Speak with Animals

Chitter and squawk.

_For the next hour you may speak with any member of the animal kingdom. This ability does not make animals any more sympathetic to you, but most can be reasoned with, to a degree._

#### Temperance

Hot and cold.

_Choose one nearby target, or yourself. The subject is unaffected by changes in temperature for the next hour._

### Level Three - The Adept

#### Flight

The gift of the Wind.

_For the next hour, you can ignore the effects of gravity and move in any direction, vertical or horizontal, at a fast walking speed._

#### Quicken

Time inside of time.

_Target yourself or one nearby character. For the next ten minutes, the subject acts at twice their normal speed. During altercations, they take two turns each round, rolling twice to determine their order score and acting on both results. Some actions—such as spellcasting—take an entire round to perform, and may not be performed twice, even while quickened._

#### Speak with Plants

The language of leaves.

_For the next hour you can speak with any member of the plant kingdom. Most plants are forthright and relatively indifferent to folk; they will willingly share what they know, but will offer little in the way of assistance._

### Level Four - The Scholar

#### Growth

More from less.

_Target yourself, another nearby character, or an item. The subject instantly doubles in size and remains so for the next hour. Successful attacks by large characters do twice as much damage._

#### Speak with the Wind

The words of the Wind.

_For the next hour you can speak with the wind. Their words are never without insight, but they often speak in riddles. Help may be offered by or requested from them, but never without complication._

#### Telekinesis

Mind over matter.

_For the next hour you may move inanimate objects and willing characters with your mind, unwilling subjects may attempt to resist. At any given time you can control one subject as if it were under the effects of the Fly spell._

### Level Five - The Master

#### Blink

Here and there.

_You can instantly transport yourself to anywhere else that you have been before._

#### Creation

Essence is abundance.

_You can create a simple handheld item or enough food and drink for up to a dozen meals out of thin air._

#### Transmute

Everything is everything.

_Target yourself, another nearby character, or an item. The subject instantly transforms into another character or item of your choosing, and remains so for the next hour._

## Spiritism

The reflections of the folk who came before are known as the Spirits Below; through Guidance they interact with the living. Practitioners of Spiritism seek this guidance and the spirits respond to those who beseech them, soothing wounds and helping light the way. But guidance, too, is sought by those with more vengeful desires—for it can also be used to do harm.

This guidance takes on countless forms—as many forms as there are spirits. Each practitioner’s relationship with those below differs, too. Some seek their aid, other seek to serve them—almost all end up doing the latter, whether they know it or not. Many types of guidance are of a dual nature: able to help or harm. The true nature and goals of the spirits are known by few, but they are respected, if not revered, by most folk.

### Level One - Empathy

#### Sense Essence

The view from Below.

_For the next hour, the caster is able to detect the presence of any nearby magical effects or powers. Lies and other means of Deceit are not automatically detected, but the caster adds one to any rolls to see through them._

_Alternatively, the caster can conceal the magical nature of any one character, item, or effect, hiding its nature for the next hour._

#### Tongues

Every language was once spoken.

_For the next hour, you or one target is able to read the text of all languages. Additionally, the subject can read any cipher whose author is dead, and adds two to any roll to understand ciphers whose authors’ are still alive._

_Alternatively, one subject is unable to read or understand anything spoken to them for the next hour, as the chatter of spirits fills their mind._

#### Transference

A gift to buoy the living—or a curse to strike them down.

_You or one character that you can touch immediately gains or loses six health. If this brings a character from zero or less health to a positive value, they immediately recover from unconsciousness and can adventure again after a short rest._

### Level Two - Purpose

#### Intention

The eyes of the past.

_The Spirits reveal to you the intentions of others. For the next hour, you can learn other characters’ general feelings towards you by looking them in the eye or or by being spoken to directly by them._

#### Pathway

The spirits guide and the spirits hide.

_For the next hour, you are able to sense the general direction of your current goal. The more specific and detailed your knowledge of your goal, the more detailed and specific the guidance will be._

_Alternatively, you can cast this spell to conceal an object. For the next hour it will go unnoticed, unless if someone is explicitly looking for it, in which case they must make an action roll to do so._

#### Share Thoughts

Of one mind.

_Target yourself or a nearby character; for the next hour, the subject can mentally communicate with others. To begin communicating with another character, they must be nearby, but the communication may continue at a distance._

### Level Three - Revelation

#### Curse

A pox upon them.

_Choose one nearby character. For the next month they subtract one from all rolls._

_Alternatively, remove a curse._

#### Ease

A cure or a cause.

_You or one character that you can touch is immediately cured of one disease._

_Alternatively, you can afflict the subject with a disease of your choice, but it must be one that you have previously cured._

#### Spirit Eyes

See without sight.

_Choose one place where you have stood before. For the next hour, you can view that area as if you were standing there again._

### Level Four - Connection

#### Dispell

An undoing.

_Remove one magical effect. Some magical items may be resistant or impervious to this guidance._

#### Protection

The spirits guard you.

_Choose up to three nearby targets, which can include yourself. For the next hour, the subjects add two to their defense, are unable to be surprised, and are instantly aware of any nearby characters that wish to do them harm._

#### Restoration

A font of energy.

_You can restore up to thirty health, split between yourself and any nearby characters of your choice._

### Level Five - Union

#### Animate

A questionable practice.

_You can animate up to three lifeless bodies or items for the next hour. They behave as Corpsefolk or similar, but under your control._

#### Commune

A question answered.

_You can ask the spirits one question, receiving a truthful—if vague—answer._

#### Rejuvination

Some endings are premature.

_You can revive one character who has failed a death check within the past day, restoring them to full health after a few hours of rest._

# Deceit

Though it whispers into every ear, none dare speak openly of Deceit. Few listen to its treacherous words, but those who would are soon versed in the tongue of Lies.
While it is the weakest form—unable to affect the Essence of Existence directly—no magic is as sinister—for the lies of deceit have the power to shape the perceptions and emotions of others; clouding their judgement and bending their very thoughts and will.

Unlike other spells, the target of a lie is always given a chance to see through its effects. Wise characters are particularly capable of seeing through lies, and add one to any rolls to resist their effects. Some lies affect more than one target; if one or more character see through the lie, the spell is broken for them but remains in place for any others.

### Level One - Deception

#### Beguile

A friendly smile and honied words.

_Target one nearby character. They must make an action roll to resist, or they will be charmed, serving you with the loyalty typically reserved for a close friend. The effects of this spell last for one day. If you beguile the same subject every day for a week, the effects last for a month._

#### Fear

There is no feeling more primal.

_Target one nearby character. They must make an action roll to resist, or they will become terrified, running away or cowering in abject fear for the next half hour._

#### Slumber

Ask not what dreams are made of.

_Target one nearby character. They must make an action roll to resist or they will fall into a deep sleep for at least one hour, longer if they are tired._

### Level Two - Illusion

#### Hallucinations

The sense are easily fooled.

_You can create an illusion that lasts for one hour. This can include sights, sounds, smells, touch, and even taste, encompassing an area as large as a room. Everything within the illusion must be inanimate, though running water, fire, contraptions and other things that move without life are perfectly acceptable. A character who has reason to suspect the illusion can make an action roll to see through it._

#### Paralyze

The mind is its own prison.

_Target up to three nearby characters. They must make an action roll to resist, or they are unable to move for the next ten minutes._

#### Vanish

A lie of omission.

_You become invisible to other folk and creatures for one hour. Attacking or touching another character causes immediate detection. A character who has reason to suspect your presence can make an action roll to detect you._

### Level Three - Subterfuge

#### Cloak of Shadows

The shadows grow long.

_This lie functions the same as Vanish but can be cast on up to three nearby targets, including oneself._

#### Incite Mood

An aimless crowd and a touch of direction.

_By exhorting a group of folk, you can induce any simple emotion within them, such as joy or hatred. Target up to three nearby characters; for each subject that fails to resist the effects, the effects spread to as many as three more nearby targets._

#### Phantasm

The illusion comes to life.

_You can create an illusion in the form of any living being that you have encountered before. This illusion can attack other characters and has the same statistics as what it represents; however, the wounds it causes are illusory, though they can render a character unconscious. If a phantasm is struck, it will dissolve._

### Level Four - Treachery

#### Dreamscape

A big lie.

_This lie functions in the same manner as Hallucinations, but can effect a much larger area, up to the size of a small field._

#### Sway

Held in rapt attention.

_You charm up to three nearby characters. For each subject that fails to resist the effects, the effect spreads to as many as three more nearby targets._

#### Terror

A spark in dry kindling.

_Terrify up to three nearby character. For each subject that fails to resist the effects, the effect spreads to as many as three more nearby targets._

### Level Five - Manipulation

#### Permanent Illusion

A lie repeated.

_This lie functions in the same manner as Hallucinations, but its effect lasts indefinitely._

#### Subjugate

Grasp the strings.

_Choose one nearby character to subjugate. They must make an action roll to resist, or they fall under your complete control, compelled do anything you command. The effects of this spell last for one day. If you subjugate the same subject every day for a week, the effects last for a month._

#### Truth

A reason for the lies after all.

_You can remove the veil of lies from the eyes of another, allowing them to see the truth of existence. What particular effect this will have varies from individual to individual, but the end result is always the same: permanent insanity._

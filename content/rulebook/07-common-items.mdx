title: Common Items
---

The following lists contain some of the more obvious items that characters may have use of, as well as their typical costs. By no means are these lists complete. When adding your own items, it is often easiest to modify existing ones, or use their statistics as a guide.

### Clothing & Armor

Clothing and armor are both worn. A character can wear one suit of armor or one pair of clothes, as well as a backpack or a bag. A character can also wear a pair of shoes, a hat, a belt, a pair of gloves, and a reasonable amount of jewelry. None of these worn items count against a character’s carrying limit.

Armor offers protection in the form of additional defense, but also hinders a character in some manner or another, depending on its bulk or class. These hindrances are cumulative; each class of armor suffers the hindrances of those before them:

- **Light** - Hinders spellcasting.
- **Medium** - Hinders climbing, sneaking, and other acrobatic actions.
- **Heavy** - Subtract two from attack rolls and one from all other rolls.

Clothing & Armor:

- Artisans Clothes - ¢10, pockets to carry one additional item.
- Backpack - ¢25, carry three additional items.
- Carapace Armor - ¢100, six additional defense, heavy.
- Chain Mail Armor - ¢50, four additional defense, medium.
- Fish Leather Armor - ¢25, two additional defense, light.
- Iron Banded Armor - ¢50, five additional defense, heavy.
- Plain Clothes - ¢5.

### Weapons & Ammunition

Weapons are meant to do harm. When used, they increase the amount of damage that an attack does. Wielding a weapon requires one free hand or paw, unless noted otherwise. Some weapons require ammunition to function, consuming it with each attack.

Certain weapons and ammunition have specific attributes:

- **For** - Signifies which weapon(s) an ammunition can be used with.
- **Large** - These weapons are unwieldily; characters must subtract two from both order rolls and attack rolls made while using them.
- **Long** - This weapon is longer than most, allowing a character to attack from a little bit further away, such as behind another character or from cover.
- **Ranged** - These weapons are used to attack nearby and far away targets, subtracting four from attack rolls against the latter.
- **Small** - This item can be bundled in groups of five for carrying.
- **Throwable** - This weapon may be thrown at a nearby target.
- **Two-handed** - This weapon requires both hands or paws to use.
- **Uses** - Signifies which ammunition a weapon uses.

- Club or Hatchet - ¢10, six-sided damage dice.
- Dagger - ¢10, four-sided damage dice, throwable, small.

### Equipment & Gear

There are all sorts of items beyond weapons, clothes, armor, and ammunition. In fact, the majority of items are those _not_ listed above. Many of these other items are tools to be used in hand or paw, others are equipment to be worn; some gear may even require a bit of set up before use.

title: Magical Traditions
---

The four magical traditions each grant spells to their practitioners. Each spell that is known by a practitioner may be cast once per day, given enough Concentration. For each level of a magical knack that a character develops, they learn the corresponding level of that tradition’s spells.

## Theurgy

When the gods above died in creation, their will became a part of all things—the Essence of Existence. To channel and manifest this will is known as Theurgy. Faithful and demanding is the path of the theurge—for devotion is the price that must be paid in exchange for the **miracles** they are afforded.

It is harmony that the theurge seeks to find through their devotion. To live in accordance with their chosen gods—and to rid the world of the inharmonious—is their purpose and goal. Harmony aside, the miracles performed by the theurge are not subtle matters. These powers effect change, often in the most violent or direct manner possible.

### Level One—Observance

**Bolt**

Righteous energy.

_Strike one nearby target for six damage._

**Shield**

Will withstands trouble.

_Choose yourself, a nearby character, or an item. The subject gains four defense for the next hour._

### Level Two—Reverence

**Bless**

Faith.

_Choose up to three nearby targets, optionally including yourself. For the next hour, the subjects gain two on all attack rolls._

**Blight**

Fury.

_Choose up to six nearby targets. For the next ten minutes, the targets subtract two from their defense and all attack rolls._

### Level Three—Dedication

**Ball of Fire**

Purification through immolation.

_Choose a small area; it erupts in a ball of fire, causing four six-sided dice of damage to any subjects within it._

**Grace**

Harmonious living.

_Choose up to three nearby targets, including yourself. For the next hour, subjects add one to all rolls._

### Level Four—Devotion

### Level Five—Sanctity

_These spells can be found in the upcoming print publication of Karst._

## Thaumaturgy

All that is everything has been woven together into the Essence of Existence; Thaumaturgy is the art and science of its transformation. To understand the nature of this essence—and reshape it to one’s own desires—is the life work of every thaumaturge, a study that is equal parts research and applied practice.

The great works of Thaumaturgy are known as **transformations**. These precise and exacting spells change the very Essence of Existence, often pushing it to one extreme or another. Though it is more direct than some forms of magic, there is still a sublime grace to art and science of Thaumaturgy.

It is claimed that Thaumaturgy was taught to folk by the wind itself, but the modern teaching and practice is far more regimented than the other magical traditions. Many a thaumaturge has undergone a formal course of study at a school or university, or began their career as an apprentice. As a result, there are many competing schools of thought, academic rivalries, and theoretical disputes amongst the thaumaturgic community.

### Level One—The Apprentice

**Lumination**

Light and shadow.

_Target one character, item, or piece of scenery, making it glow brightly or absorb nearby light, illuminating the area nearby or casting it into complete darkness. This effect lasts for one hour. If cast on the eyes of a character, they are blinded for the spell’s duration._

**Magnetism**

Attraction and repulsion.

_Choose two targets, such as characters, items, or scenery. For the next hour, they are either fused together or repel each other with great strength._

**Purity**

Time and change.

_You can age or reverse the aging of a dozen meals’ worth of food and drink, making them edible or inedible in the process. This spell can be cast on a similar amount of any other lifeless matter—rotting it or purifying it—including wood._

### Level Two—The Student

**Levitation**

Up and down.

_Target yourself, a willing character, or a nearby item. For the next hour, the effects of gravity upon the subject are replaced by your whims. The subject cannot be made to rise more quickly than a fast walking speed or fall faster than the speed of gravity._

**Speak with Animals**

Chitter and squawk.

_For the next hour, you may speak with any member of the animal kingdom. This ability does not make animals any more sympathetic to you, but most can be reasoned with, to a degree._

**Temperance**

Hot and cold.

_Choose one nearby target, or yourself. The subject is unaffected by changes in temperature for the next hour._

### Level Three—The Adept

**Flight**

The gift of the wind.

_For the next hour, you can ignore the effects of gravity and move in any direction, vertical or horizontal, at a fast walking speed._

**Quicken**

Time inside of time.

_Target yourself or one nearby character. For the next ten minutes, the subject acts at twice their normal speed. During altercations, they take two turns each round, rolling twice to determine their order score and acting on both results. Some actions—such as spell-casting—take an entire round to perform and may not be performed twice, even while quickened._

**Speak with Plants**

The language of leaves.

_For the next hour, you can speak with any member of the plant kingdom. Most plants are forthright and relatively indifferent to folk; they will willingly share what they know but will offer little in the way of assistance._

### Level Four—The Scholar

_These spells can be found in the upcoming print publication of Karst._

### Level Five—The Master

_These spells can be found in the upcoming print publication of Karst._

## Spiritism

The reflections of the folk who came before are known as the spirits below; through **guidance** they interact with the living. Practitioners of Spiritism seek this guidance, and the spirits respond to those who beseech them, soothing wounds and helping light the way. But guidance, too, is sought by those with more vengeful desires—for it can also be used to do harm.

This guidance takes on countless forms—as many forms as there are spirits. Each practitioner’s relationship with those below differs too. Some seek their aid; others seek to serve them—almost all end up doing the latter, whether they know it or not. Many types of guidance are of a dual nature: able to help or harm. The true nature and goals of the spirits are known by few, but they are respected, if not revered, by most folk.

### Level One—Empathy

**Sense Essence**

The view from below.

\_For the next hour, you are able to detect the presence of any nearby magical effects or powers. Lies and other means of Deceit are not automatically detected, but you add one to any rolls to see through them.\_\_

_Alternatively, you can conceal the magical nature of any one character, item, or effect, hiding its nature for the next hour._

**Tongues**

Every language was once spoken.

_Target yourself or a nearby character; for the next hour, the subject is able to read the text of all languages. Additionally, the subject can read any cipher whose author is dead, and adds two to any roll to understand ciphers whose authors’ are still alive._

_Alternatively, one subject is unable to read or understand anything spoken to them for the next hour, as the chatter of spirits fills their mind._

**Transference**

A gift to buoy the living—or a curse to strike them down.

_Target yourself or one character who is close enough to touch; the subject immediately gains or loses six health. If this brings a character from zero or less health to a positive value, they immediately recover from unconsciousness and can adventure again after a short rest. During an altercation, you may need to successfully attack an unwilling target in order to touch them._

### Level Two—Purpose

**Intention**

The eyes of the past.

_The Spirits reveal to you the intentions of others. For the next hour, you can learn other characters’ general feelings towards you by looking them in the eye or by being spoken to directly by them._

**Pathway**

The spirits guide and the spirits hide.

_For the next hour, you are able to sense the general direction of your current goal. The more specific and detailed your knowledge of your goal, the more detailed and specific the guidance will be._

_Alternatively, you can cast this spell to conceal an object. For the next hour, it will go unnoticed unless someone is explicitly looking for it, in which case they must make an action roll to do so._

**Share Thoughts**

Of one mind.

_Target yourself or a nearby character; for the next hour, the subject can mentally communicate with others. To begin communicating with another character, they must be nearby, but the communication may continue at a distance._

### Level Three—Revelation

**Curse**

A pox upon them.

_Choose one nearby character. For the next month, they subtract one from all rolls._

_Alternatively, remove a curse._

**Ease**

A cure or a cause.

_Target yourself or one character that you can touch; the subject is immediately cured of one disease._

_Alternatively, you can afflict the subject with a disease of your choice, but it must be one that you have previously cured. During an altercation, you may need to successfully attack an unwilling target in order to touch them._

**Spirit Eyes**

See without sight.

_Choose one place where you have stood before. For the next hour, you can view that area as if you were there again._

### Level Four—Connection

_These spells can be found in the upcoming print publication of Karst._

### Level Five—Union

_These spells can be found in the upcoming print publication of Karst._

## Deceit

Though it whispers into every ear, none dare speak openly of Deceit. Few listen to its treacherous words, but those who do are soon versed in the tongue of **lies**.

While it is the weakest form—unable to affect the Essence of Existence directly—no magic is as sinister: the lies of Deceit have the power to shape the perceptions and emotions of others, clouding their judgment and bending their very thoughts and will.

The target of a lie, however, is always given a chance to see through its effects, unlike with other spells. Characters who are Wise are particularly capable of seeing through lies and add one to any rolls to resist their effects. Some lies affect more than one target; if one or more characters see through the lie, the spell is broken for them but remains in place for any others.

### Level One—Deception

**Beguile**

A friendly smile and honied words.

_Target one nearby character. They must make an action roll to resist, or they will be beguiled, serving you with the loyalty typically reserved for a close friend. The effects of this spell last for one day. If you beguile the same subject every day for a week, the effects last for a month._

**Fear**

There is no feeling more primal.

_Target one nearby character. They must make an action roll to resist, or they will become terrified, running away or cowering in abject fear for the next half hour._

**Slumber**

Ask not what dreams are made of.

_Target one nearby character. They must make an action roll to resist, or they will fall into a deep sleep for at least one hour, longer if they are tired._

### Level Two—Illusion

**Hallucinations**

The senses are easily fooled.

_You can create an illusion that lasts for one hour. This can include sights, sounds, smells, touch, and even taste, encompassing an area as large as a room. Everything within the illusion must be inanimate, though running water, fire, contraptions, and other things that move without life are perfectly acceptable. A character who has reason to suspect the illusion can make an action roll to see through it._

**Paralyze**

The mind is its own prison.

_Target up to three nearby characters. They must make an action roll to resist, or they are unable to move for the next ten minutes._

**Vanish**

A lie of omission.

_You become invisible to other folk and creatures for one hour. Attacking or touching another character causes immediate detection. A character who has reason to suspect your presence can make an action roll to detect you._

### Level Three—Subterfuge

**Cloak of Shadows**

The shadows grow long.

_This lie functions the same as Vanish but can be cast on up to three nearby targets, including oneself, concealing them from all observers._

**Incite Mood**

An aimless crowd and a touch of direction.

_By exhorting a group of folk, you can induce any simple emotion within them, such as joy or hatred. Target up to three nearby characters; for each subject that fails to resist the effects, the effects spread to as many as three more nearby targets._

**Phantasm**

The illusion comes to life.

_You can create an illusion that takes the form of any living being that you have encountered before. This fabricated character or creature can attack other characters and has the same statistics as the being it represents; however, the wounds it causes are illusory, though they can render a character unconscious. If a phantasm is struck, it will dissolve._

### Level Four—Treachery

_These spells can be found in the upcoming print publication of Karst._

### Level Five—Manipulation

_These spells can be found in the upcoming print publication of Karst._

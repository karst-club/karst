title: Common Items
---

The following lists contain some of the more obvious items that characters may use, as well as their benefits, drawbacks, and typical costs. By no means are these lists complete. When adding your own items, it is often easiest to modify existing ones, or use their statistics as a guide.

### Clothing & Armor

**Clothing** and **armor** are worn and do not count against a character’s carrying limit. Armor offers protection in the form of additional defense but also hinders a character in some manner or another, depending on its bulk or class. These hindrances are cumulative: each class of armor also suffers the hindrances of those before them.

- _**Light**_—Hinders spellcasting.
- _**Medium**_—Hinders climbing, sneaking, and other acrobatic actions.
- _**Heavy**_—Subtract two from attack rolls and one from all other rolls.

A character can wear one suit of armor or one pair of clothes, as well as a backpack or a bag. A character can also wear a pair of shoes, a hat, a belt, a pair of gloves, and a reasonable amount of jewelry.

**Artisan clothes**—¢10, pockets to carry one additional item.

**Carapace armor**—¢100, six additional defense, heavy.

**Chain-mail armor**—¢50, four additional defense, medium.

**Fish-leather armor**—¢25, two additional defense, light.

**Iron-banded armor**—¢50, five additional defense, heavy.

**Plain clothes**—¢5.

### Weapons & Ammunition

**Weapons** are meant to do harm. When used, they increase the amount of damage from an attack. Some weapons require **ammunition**, which is consumed with each attack. Wielding a weapon requires one free hand or paw, unless noted otherwise.

Certain weapons and ammunition have specific attributes:

- _**For**_—Signifies which weapon(s) an ammunition can be used with.
- _**Large**_—These weapons are unwieldly; characters must subtract two from both order rolls and attack rolls made while using them.
- _**Long**_—These weapons are longer than most, allowing a character to attack from a little bit farther away, such as behind another character or from cover.
- _**Ranged**_—These weapons are used to attack nearby and faraway targets, subtracting four from attack rolls against the latter.
- _**Small**_—These weapons can be bundled in groups of five for carrying purposes.
- _**Throwable**_—These weapons may be thrown at a nearby target.
- _**Two-handed**_—These weapons require two hands or paws to wield.
- _**Uses**_—Signifies which ammunition a weapon uses.

The most commonly available weapons and ammunition include the following:

**Bow**—¢25, six-sided damage dice, two-handed, ranged, uses arrows.

**Club** or **hatchet**—¢10, six-sided damage dice.

**Dagger**—¢10, four-sided damage dice, throwable, small.

**Large bow**—¢50, eight-sided damage dice, two-handed, large, ranged, uses arrows.

**Large sword** or **axe**—¢50, ten-sided damage dice, two-handed, large.

**Sling**—¢5, four-sided damage dice, ranged, uses stones.

**Spear**—¢25, six-sided damage dice, long, throwable.

**Staff**—¢5, four-sided damage dice, long.

**Sword** or **axe**—¢25, eight-sided damage dice.

Ten **stones**—¢0, for slings.

_Karst is played as a shared dialog between the players and narrator._ These rules provide a framework—guidelines—for how this dialog is conducted and how dramatic situations can be resolved using creativity and chance.

## The Two Rules

In truth, there are only two rules to the game of Karst—the rest are mere suggestions.

_The first rule is to be reasonable._ There are many places in between the rules as written and the stories you tell that have been left up to your taste and judgment. It is assumed that you will approach these areas with good faith, whether as a player or narrator. Where there are unspoken rules and uncertainty in the text, search not for loopholes, but apply common sense rulings instead. Better still, view these gaps as opportunities to incorporate the ideas that fit the needs of your game and story.

_The second rule—which builds heavily upon the first—is to serve the story._ The goal of the game is not for one party or another to “win”, but for you to tell a story together. No matter your role in the telling, it is your objective to nurture the narrative and help it along, adding your own marks in the process.

In a sense, these two rules are one: Karst is played together.

# Scenes

No matter how else they are formed, _the stories told in Karst are made up of Scenes._ These are the events and interactions that matter to the players and their understanding of the story; in almost all scenes, at least one player’s character is present.

_A scene is a dialog._ It typically begins with the narrator describing a situation. Next, the players ask the narrator any questions they might have about the scene, or state any actions that their characters are taking.
 The narrator answers player questions as they see fit and describes the outcome of character actions, noting how the scene has changed as a result. If there are other characters or creatures in the scene, the narrator describes their actions, as well.

This continues back and forth until the scene reaches a conclusion, transitioning to another scene or ending the current chapter of the story.

## Actions

_If a player wants their character to do something, they say so; this is called an Action._ The narrator narrates the result of the action or invites the player to do so. Sometimes, the narrator will determine that the character has failed or is unable to perform the action, describing instead the failure.

**Creative or reasonable actions should almost always be rewarded by the narrator.** This encourages emergent storytelling and engagement more than anything else.

### Action Rolls

_When the narrator can’t decide the outcome of an action, they can call for a roll of the dice to determine what happens. This is called an Action Roll._

**Action rolls are the core dice-based mechanic of Karst.**

_To make an action roll, the player or narrator rolls a six-sided die on behalf of the character. If the roll is a six or higher (as a result of modifiers), the action is a success. Otherwise, it is a failure._ Modifiers can add to or subtract from the roll, but if the dice shows a one, the action ends in failure. Similarly, if the dice shows a six, the action is successful.

**Action rolls can be used for many purposes.** When a horrible thing is about to happen to a character, a roll can sometimes be made to avoid part or all of the effects; this is known as a reaction roll. Opposed contests, too, can be handled using action rolls: both parties make an action roll and then compare the results to see if one side prevails.

When the outcome of an action roll would not be immediately apparent to the player performing it, the narrator can roll in secret, revealing the result when appropriate.

**An important note about action rolls is that they should be used sparingly.** Players are meant to be rewarded for their creativity; characters are capable folk, and rolls are not made just for the sake of rolling dice. Limiting action rolls to the big moments in a game also makes their outcomes more memorable and impactful. That said, it is your game to play; if you like rolling dice for every action, go for it.

# Altercations

Scenes are generally free-flowing discussions, but there are tense moments, when the order in which different characters act becomes vitally important. _When some form of confrontation arises between characters, the scene becomes an Altercation._ A slightly more structured procedure for handling actions, altercations can be used at any moment of dramatic tension within a story.

## Rounds & Order

_An altercation is made up of successive Rounds._ During a round, each character is given a Turn to act. To determine the order of action in each round, every character involved must first determine their Order Score. This is done by way of an Order Roll.

_At the beginning of the round, each player with a character in the altercation rolls a six-sided dice, often with modifiers. The narrator does the same for any others involved._

_Going from the highest score to the lowest each characters takes their turn._ Those with the same score act simultaneously.

Altercations sometimes start in a surprising manner. _If there is a chance that a character would be caught unaware by the beginning of an altercation, they must first succeed at an action roll—known as a Surprise Roll—or they will be surprised and unable to act in the altercation’s first round._

## Turns

_On their turn, a character can take one action._ They may also walk a short distance or say a few words, but anything beyond that is an action itself.

Sometimes, a character may wish to do two things at once. If both of these actions are reasonable, one action is simpler than the other, and the character’s order score is at least four, the character can do so—but they must subtract three from their order score, acting later in the round as a result.

A character may not generally defer their action—they must act now or forfeit the opportunity. However, a character can prepare an action in response to a specific condition, which must be stated. If that condition occurs, so too does the action. Otherwise, at the start of the character’s next turn, the unsused action is effectively lost.

## Attacks

Altercations often turn violent. In these situations—or any other time that someone wishes to do harm—_a character can use an action to Attack a target._ This target may be another character or an inanimate object.

_To attempt an attack, the player or narrator rolls a twenty-sided die. They succeed if the result is equal to or above the target’s defense._ Attack rolls often have modifiers, based on the participants involved and the situation at hand, but no matter the modifiers, or the target’s defense, an attack always succeeds on a roll of twenty and always fails on a roll of one.

### Damage

_A successful attack does Damage to the target._ Damage is not the only effect that an attack may have, but all attacks do at least one damage—even unarmed ones. For armed attacks, the amount of damage is based on the weapon being used. When a target is unaware of an attack, the damage is doubled. _Once the damage has been determined, it is subtracted from the target’s health; next, any other effects of the attack are resolved._

_If a character’s health is reduced to zero or less, they are immediately knocked out of the altercation._ Similarly, an object that is sufficiently damaged will be destroyed. More information about health and the consequences of losing it are outlined in the section on Injury and Death.

## Resolution

_At the end of each round, the narrator determines if the altercation should continue._ If one side has been defeated, that’s the end of things, but there are other reasons why an altercation might end—some more peaceful than others.

The end of an altercation may return the action to the scene at hand, or it may transition the game to a new scene or chapter in the story. In some cases, the resolution of an altercation can even conclude the story—tragically or heroically.

## Injury & Death

The consequences of action are sometimes physical. A character’s health is an abstract representation of their well-being, stamina, fortitude, and resolve—perhaps even their luck. Physical injury is not the only way that a character can lose health, but it is the most common. As health is lost, a character comes closer to a breaking point.

A character who has lost some of their health is harried and perhaps lightly wounded—nothing that can’t be cured by a warm meal and bit of rest—but those who have lost all of their health are in trouble. To begin with, a character that has lost all health is knocked unconscious for the rest of the encounter. Worse, they are seriously wounded and have a good chance of dying, especially if left unattended.

_Immediately after being reduced to zero health or less, a character must make a Death Roll. This is done by rolling a six-sided die and subtracting any negative health from the result. If the result is one, the character has died._ If the result is a six or above, modified or on the dice, the character is wounded but will survive. Any other result is inconclusive; the character remains at death’s door and must roll again at the end of the next round.

_A character can use an action to attempt to administer aid to a seriously wounded character, making a death roll for them._ A successful roll has the same effect as if the injured character had succeeded, but a roll of one will only reduce the target’s health by one further, rather than outright killing them.

There are fates other than death that may befall characters; certain forms of injury may include effects beyond damage. The nature and effect of these effects should be tailored to each case, as is appropriate and fitting to the story or situation.

### Recovery

Characters who have lost some of their health have various ways of regaining it. _A hot meal and a good night’s sleep will restore lost health,_ but there are other methods of recovery when one is in a pinch for time.

_Sitting down for an hour and eating a meal is an effective pick-me-up. Any character that does this regains three health._ This can be done up to twice a day, beyond which is a waste of time and food.

Magical spells, abilities, and potions are often the fastest way of restoring lost health, but also the most scarce. Some magical effects are even capable of temporarily increasing health beyond its maximum value.

_A character who has lost all of their health but has succeeded at a death roll must recuperate before adventuring again._ After being carried back to safety and shelter, they must spend at least a full week in bed. Once recuperated, a character is restored to full health, but may have some kind of permanent scar or injury.

# Items

Items enable character actions. Character identity, too, is often wound up in items. Stories are filled with folk that are known more for the things they wear and the items they carry than for any other details about who they are.

Anything that can be worn, held, carried, or used in the hands or paws of a character is considered an item—quite the range. To help delineate between them, all items belong to one of three kinds: Common, Special, and Magical.

Most items are of the common variety: these are the everyday tools, equipment, and clothes found throughout the archipelago. Some common items can be more difficult to find or make than others, but, otherwise, there is nothing remarkable about them. Remarkable or not, giving individual common items a little bit of personality is highly encouraged.

Special items, on the other hand, are just that: items which are unique, rare, or particularly important to the story. These are usually a specific copy of some type of common item, and can be treated as such, with any details handled on a per-item basis.

Lastly, there are Magical items: these extra-special items have been imbued with some form of magical power, and are subject to their own rules. Some magical items share identical powers and effects, but each one is unique.

## Carrying Items

_Characters can carry five items, two of which can be held in hand or paw. This limit does not include clothing, armor, or a backpack._ Small items can be grouped together into bundles of five, which are treated as a single item for carrying purposes.

A character who is burdened with more items than the limit will become fatigued after just a few minutes of exertion. Those who are both strong and tough will persevere a little longer, becoming fatigued after an hour of carrying one or two items above the limit.

Some items are heavier or bulkier than others. These items can slow down or otherwise hinder a character who carries, wears, or wields them, regardless of what else they are carrying.

### Coins

There are many currencies found within the Karst Archipelago, but there is only one denomination: the Coin. _No matter the currency, one coin (¢1) is worth as much as the next, and all coins are of a similar size and weight. For carrying purposes, a sack or pouch with up to ¢100 is considered a single item._

## Using Items

There are many different types of items: Weapons, Tools, Armor, Clothing, Equipment, and Gear. An item’s type determines how it can be used. Some items may be worn, while others can be wielded. All types of items may be carried, either in hand or paw, strapped to a belt, or inside of another item designed for the purpose.

Certain items are consumed with usage. Others are not inherently consumable, but may be used in a disposable manner. Lastly, no item is indestructible—anything can be broken with enough effort.

# Magic

The Karst Archipelago is steeped in magic. From subtle illusions to overt transformations, the use of magic is not uncommon, though neither is it an everyday occurrence. There are four types, forms, or traditions of magic, each with its own connection to the cosmology of the world. They are Theurgy, Thaumaturgy, Spiritism, and Deceit. These traditions and the spells they grant are discussed further in the chapter, Magical Traditions.

## Practicing Magic

A Practitioner of magic is any character who can cast spells. Strictly speaking, this means that they have developed at least one level of the Concentration knack. Practically speaking, there is little magic that can be practiced without spells to cast.

Spells are learned by becoming versed in a magical tradition. To do so, a character must develop a level in any of the four magical knacks—Deceit, Spiritism, Thaumaturgy, or Theurgy—granting them the knowledge of the equivalent level of that tradition’s spells. These spells and descriptions of their effects can be found in the chapter, Magical Traditions.

### Spell Casting

As an action, a practitioner can cast a spell. The effects of many spells are instantaneous and permanent, though others may grow with time or fade after a short while; each spell is unique.

A character can cast any spell they know, with two conditions: they can only cast as many spells per day as they have levels of concentration, and each individual spell can only be cast once in a day. For this purpose, a “day” refers to the time a character goes between sleeping soundly.

The methods by which each practitioner casts their magic vary: be it through gestures, words, or simple thought. In all cases, the act of casting takes only an instant, but requires much concentration. If a character is restrained, has already been attacked in the current round of an altercation, or is otherwise harried, it is assumed that they are unable to concentrate enough to cast a spell.

## Magical Powers

Certain magical items and knacks grant characters the ability to use spell-like powers. Using these powers typically requires an action, much like casting a spell, but with rules specific to the item or ability in question. Often, the effects of these powers are similar to those of a specific spell, and will be describes as being so. Similarities aside, the possession of one or more of these powers does not make a character a practitioner of magic.

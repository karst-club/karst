  # Karst
  A downtempo post-apocalyptic RPG with themes of adventure, exploration, and soft terror.
  
  ## Hook
  It has been a generation since the last boat arrived or returned from the now distant
  shores of our various homelands. Out here in the Archipelago, life has gone on. Most
  folk cling to island shores. Here, they form alliances with their neighbors and tend
  to the dying embers of civilization. Still others, restless and possessed, strike out
  to seek their fortune upon the waves.
  
  You are one of these folk, out for glory, riches, power, or similar.

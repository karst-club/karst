  Bright, dexterous, and charming, the diminutive Lagartos are known as a
  clever folk, for better and worse.

  Native to the shores of the Southern Swamps, the Lagartos are a clever Folk and
  were quick to join with the Visita when the latter began settling floating cities
  along the banks of the swamps. The arrangement worked out well for both Folk,
  with the Lagartos content to let the Visita assume public leadership while they
  went about installing themselves as the power behind the throne.

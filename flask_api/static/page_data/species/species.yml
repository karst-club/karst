  The world of Karst is one with multiple sentient species of roughly the same
  intellect, size, and capabilities. Collectively these species refer to themselves
  as the Folk. Of note, there is no dominant species among the folk, this is not
  "the Age of the Visita", or anyone else. Though each species has a homeland and
  areas where they are more populous, Folk frequently intermingle, especially out
  in the Archipelago where circumstance have drawn many closer together.

  These are the the sentient species that make up the primary inhabitants of the
  Karst Archipelago.

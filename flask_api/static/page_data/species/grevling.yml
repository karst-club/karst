  A sturdy, skeptical, folk, Grevlings have a reputation for keeping social organizations together.

  Sturdy, clannish, and skeptical, the Grevlings have inhabited the Eastern Woods since time
  immemorial, once in fear, but now as its master. The history and identity of this proud Folk
  revolves around the campaigns they waged to beat back the Wolves, and civilize the Woods.
  Yes, the Eekhorns helped, but it was the indomitable spirit of the Grevlings and their priests
  that led the day when all seemed lost in the darkest of winter.

  A bushy-tailed, nut-loving folk, the Eekhorn are known for being high energy,
  high strung, and quick to action.

  Hailing from the Eastern Woods, the Eekhorn descended from an ancient tree-dwelling
  race. They possess large, bushy, tails and a good sense of balance, making them naturally
  adept at climbing.

  The Eekhorn have a reputation for being high-strung, quick to act, and even quicker to
  react. At its best, this trait manifests as decisive, bold, and adaptive leadership. More
  negativity, it can be expressed as an impulsive, unfocused, and unreliable temperament.

  There are relatively few Eekhorn in the Karst Archipelago, but they are involved in
  nautical trades to an even higher degree than most other Folk. Their innate balance
  and aptitude for climbing make the Eekhorn natural sailors, explaining why they make
  up such a large portion of those in the profession.

  Somewhat hot for them in places

  Often cut parts of their fur really short in simple tattoo like designs.

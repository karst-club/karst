Mortimer T Wilkers, 4th mate

Me and Xosa finally signed up with another Going Concern today after finding one rowdy enough for our tastes. No easy task in Eektorp Bay these days where everything is aboveboard and on the up-and-up, but somehow this vessel had both avoided suspicion from the harbor master and had an urgent need for a pair of deck hands who weren’t too squeamish. We sail with them tomorrow.

It’s been three days at sea and I already feel a part of the crew. Last night, the captain told us how he and a couple other crew members liberated the ship from its previous owner, a wealthy and stuck-up merchant. Sounds like he had it coming. Now that we’re far enough out at sea, tomorrow we plan to begin the search for our first target. I hope this one’s an even richer merchant than the one the captain threw overboard.

We found and plundered our first target, but a powerful Theurge who was traveling aboard the vessel made us pay dearly for it. She killed two of our crew and wounded three more including Xosa before I put her down with my blade. The captain commended my actions with an extra share of the loot.

Xosa has died from her wounds and was buried at sea, her shares divided among the crew. She will be missed. In the evening we spied another merchant vessel and attacked in darkness. Their ship was laden with food, which the captain said will fetch a princely Sunn in Drakt Harbor.

We arrived in Drakt Harbor today, it is dirtier than I expected, but otherwise lives up to its reputation. The captain was correct, our cargo has obtained the attention of multiple bidders. We will carouse tonight and complete the deal on the morrow.

Illarsh, one of the Lagartos in the crew was stabbed to death over dice last night. The captain said he probably had it coming, but it didn’t seem like it to me. No matter, the cargo fetched good coin and we are set to sail again.

We found a cove on a small island that’s perfect for hiding the ship and our loot. There’s a town on the other side of the island, but the captain says he struck a deal with some of the villagers to leave us alone. All we have to do is to steer clear of any merchants stopping off at the island, seems fair enough.

...

The ship was damaged in the last raid, the villagers the captain made a deal with said their son was a boat maker, perhaps he could help with the repairs?

...

The captain has run off with half the crew to the palms, claiming there’s an invaluable treasure buried beneath them. I’ve dispatched Dej and Ashi to spy on what they are up to and report back.

Dej and Ashi returned, along with a few of the other traitors. They tried to steal the ship, but we were able to stop them. Unfortunately, the ship is half-wrecked in the middle of the cove now and we lost another two crew to the blades of the traitors. Tomorrow, the remainder of us march on the former captain and the rest of the traitors and end this for good.

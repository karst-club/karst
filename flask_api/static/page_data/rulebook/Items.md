There are all sorts of Items that Characters can use in their adventures. Some examples are listed below. When purchasing an item be sure to write down a couple of words about what makes it unique.

## Weapons

Tools for violent disagreements.

### Blunt
These weapons don't draw blood, directly. Some Folk think it's more wholesome that way.

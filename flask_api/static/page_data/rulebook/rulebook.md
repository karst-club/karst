Karst is a role playing game inspired by the classics. The rules are lightweight and easy to modify or use with other systems and content. 

The game is set in a fantasy world with many species, but no humans. It eschews the traditional concept of a character class in favor of a simple, configurable, system of character customization.

To play, you will need a Referee and one or more Players. Each Player controls a **P**layer **C**haracter within the game world, while the Referee controls the world itself, describing it to the Players and determining how it responds to their Charactersâ€™ actions. Collaboratively, the Players and Referee create a story.

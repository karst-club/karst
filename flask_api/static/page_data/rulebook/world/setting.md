# Overview
The game takes place in the Karst Archipelago, a collection of islands in the Mirror Sea.
The Archipelago was once situated between three continents, the Eastern Woods, the Western
Sands, and the Southern Swamps but it has been a generation since boats have arrived or
returned from those now-distant shores.

# Things

## The Gods Above
In the skies Above reside the Hollow Gods, they that have given of themselves to create
Existence. It is said that their Will lives on in all things and that their original
Intent may still be channeled by those with Knowledge and Faith of Theurgy.

## The Spirits Below
Our great ancestors dwell in the Far Below. Those that may speak with them possess the
Oracle of Spiritism.

## The Essence of Existence
The raw material from which we are all formed. Thaumaturgy is the Art and Science of
bending this Essence to oneâ€™s Will.

## The Whispers In the Wings
For every bit of belief and surety, there exists a doubt. The Whispers speak through
this doubt. To Learn their Tongue is to Speak the Language of Deceit.

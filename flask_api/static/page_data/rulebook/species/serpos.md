Some folk have issue trusting the Serpos at face value, but none
can deny their deep insight and wisdom.

Sharp-eyed, methodical, wise, cold, ancient. The Serpos can trace the history of their
culture back to the days of yore, when they were one of the great empires. The modern-day
Serpos, inhabitants of the Western Sands, live in the shadows of their once glorious past,
metaphorically and physically. 

As the first to discover the Art of Thaumaturgy, the ancient Serpos were able to forge a
civilization and dominate the landscape around them. As their empire grew, so did their
corruption, as Deceit became practiced at the highest levels of their leadership. 

They subjugated and dominated their neighbors, the Veldlings, who eventually fought back,
leading to a protracted war and the beginning of the end for the first Serpos empire.
Though they ultimately drove the Veldlings from the Western Sands, it came with the
use of great magic and even greater sacrifices, crippling and bankrupting the civilization
both morally and monetarily.

In the centuries since, the Serpos have emerged as a more agreeable and collaborative
Folk, but old prejudices, suspicions, and bad-blood still haunt their reputation. While
their powers have greatly diminished, they remain a highly-educated people, placing much
stock in the pursuit of knowledge and secrets.

Possessing an entrepreneurial spirit, the Veldling make for gracious hosts and
brave, but cautious, adventurers.

Originally from the Western Sands, the Veldlings were driven out of their homelands
by the Serpos centuries ago after a long period animosity between the two Folk. Most
Veldlings resettled in the Eastern Woods alongside the Grevlings and Eekhorn, but many
found their way to the Karst Archipelago.

Veldlings are brave, but measured, Folk. They know that discretion is often the better
part of valor, a trait that makes for fine adventurers. As careful as they are, they
are equally (if not more-so) ambitious. Furthermore, they are a sociable lot, for the
most part, and enjoy the situations that arise from interpersonal interactions. These
aspects of the Veldlings' psyche help explain why many traveling merchants and shopkeepers
are members of this Folk.

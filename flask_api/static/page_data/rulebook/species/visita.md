Stalwart, Just, Even-Keeled, Charming, and Benevolent, the Visita are regarded as a
regal and storied folk.

The Visita have always been leaders. From their birth in the backwaters of the Southern
Swamps, to the rise of their floating cities along the tributaries of the great river,
to the dawn and expansion of their seaborne mercantile empire, the Visita have stood for
progress, prosperity, and nobility.

Power driven / noble Visita become smooth skin? Mercantile and working class become
rough skin? Maybe nah?

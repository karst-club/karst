Sturdy, clannish, and skeptical, the Grevlings have inhabited the Eastern Woods since time
immemorial, once in fear, but now as its master. The history and identity of this proud Folk
revolves around the campaigns they waged to beat back the Wolves, and civilize the Woods.
Yes, the Eekhorns helped, but it was the indomitable spirit of the Grevlings and their priests
that led the day when all seemed lost in the darkest of winter.

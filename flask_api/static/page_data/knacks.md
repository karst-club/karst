Knacks are part of what make individuals different and special.

Everyone has a Knack for something, starting with a singular Knack at Level 0.

You Develop two Knacks for every odd-numbered level you reach and one Knack for every
even-numbered level.

Some Knacks May be Developed more than once but only once per level. Some Knacks
require other Prerequisite Knacks.

Anyone may develop Basic Knacks but you must reach Level 5 to develop Expert Knacks
and Level 10 to develop Master Knacks.

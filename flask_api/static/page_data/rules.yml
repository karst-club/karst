  # Rules

  # Overview

  Karst is a role playing game inspired by the classics. The rules are lightweight and easy to
  modify or use with other systems and content. 

  The game is set in a fantasy world with many species, but no humans. It eschews the traditional
  concept of a character class in favor of a simple, configurable, system of character customization.

  To play, you will need a Referee and one or more Players. Each Player controls a **P**layer
  **C**haracter within the game world, while the Referee controls the world itself, describing
  it to the Players and determining how it responds to their Characters‚Äô actions. Collaboratively,
  the Players and Referee create a story.

  # Characters & Stats
  These rules govern Player Characters foremost, but also cover **N**on-**P**layer **C**haracters controlled by the Referee.

  ## Species & Monsters
  Karst is a world with multiple sentient Species, or Folk, each with their own traits, cultures,
  and abilities. All Player Characters belong to one of these Species, as do many NPCs.

  Monster is a catch-all term for any NPC that is not one of these Species.

  ## Attributes

  Characters have six attributes:

  - **Str**ength
  - **Dex**terity
  - **Con**stitution
  - **Int**elligence
  - **Wis**dom
  - **Cha**risma

  Their value ranges from 3 to 18, determined by a roll of 3d6.

  An attribute‚Äôs value corresponds to a modifier which ranges from -3 to +3

  - **3:** -3
  - **4 - 5:** -2
  - **6 - 8:** -1
  - **9 - 12:** 0
  - **13 - 15:** +1
  - **16 - 17:** +2
  - **18:** +3

  Modifiers affect rolls related to the attribute, reflecting the strengths and weaknesses of
  Characters.

  ## Levels and Experience Points (XP)
  All characters have a Level, which denotes how Experienced they are. Most NPCs are Level 0,
  but PCs start at Level 1.

  PCs track experience using E**x**perience **P**oints, which are gained from spending loot and
  vanquishing foes. When a Character gains enough XP, they gain a level and all the bonuses
  associated with it.

  The higher the level of a character, the more hit points they have, the better their saves are,
  and the more extraordinary things they are capable of doing. These extraordinary things are
  called Knacks.

  ## Hit Points (HP)
  All Characters have one or more **H**it **P**oints and die if they lose them all.

  Food and rest can restore HP back to their original value.

  Every time a character gains a level they roll a d6 hit die modified by their Con and add it
  to their permanent HP.

  ## Armor Class (AC)
  **A**rmor **C**lass represents how hard/difficult it is to hit (and Damage) a Character.

  Everyone starts with an AC of 10, modified by Dex.

  Armor increases AC but can also slow a Character down.

  A shield improves a Character‚Äôs AC by 1 but gives them a -2 to-hit modifier.

  ## Knacks
  Knacks are what make Characters special.

  Everyone has a Knack for something, starting at Level Zero.

  As Characters gain levels, they develop the Knack for more things, developing two Knacks
  at every odd numbered level and one at every even numbered level.

  Aside from more Hit Dice and Saving Throw improvements, Knacks are the only form of character
  advancement. Want to pick locks, cast more spells, or get better at striking your opponents?
  Develop the Knack for it.

  ## Equipment, Weapons, Gear, and Loot
  Characters don Armor, wield Weapons, and use Equipment and Gear in their adventures to find
  and recover Loot. If a Character is obviously carrying too may items or too much weight, they
  become Encumbered.

  # Scenes and Actions
  The game is mostly comprised of Scenes. 

  The Referee starts a Scene by describing the situation to the Players. The Players then ask
  the Referee questions and state what Actions their Characters are taking. The Referee answers
  questions and describes the outcomes of Character Actions.

  ## Actions
  When a Player wants their PC to do something, they say so. This is an Action.

  Generally speaking, when a Player declares an Action it happens and the Referee describes the result.

  Sometimes, the Referee will determine that the PC has failed at the Action and will describe the
  result of the failure.

  ### Rolling for Success
  When there is doubt about whether or not a PC would succeed at an Action, or if success and
  failure are both interesting outcomes, the Referee may set odds and have the Player roll a d6
  to determine what happens. 

  Actions based on Attributes are modified by them. Modifiers may never bring the odds below 1 in
  6 and if the odds are modified to 6 in 6 or higher, success should be automatic or failure should
  only occur on a roll of 12 on 2d6 (1 in 36 odds).

  When the outcome would not be immediately apparent to the Character, the Referee may roll in secret
  instead.

  The last and most important thing about rolling for success is that it should happen infrequently.

  ## Saving Throws
  When Actions and other events might cause Bad Things to happen to a Character, they will sometimes
  have the chance to make a Saving Throw to try and minimize or avoid the effects.

  The character rolls a d20 and adds 1 for every even-numbered level they have reached, as well as
  any other modifiers. If the score is equal to or higher than 15, they have successfully Saved.
  (15|16 for Poison/Petrify, 18|20 for Elements/Magic?)

  There are four types of Saving Throws: 

  - Poison/Death
  - Petrify/Paralysis
  - Elements
  - Magic

  Magic Saving Throws are modified by a Character's Wis.

  # **Encounters and Combat**
  Scenes are generally a free-flowing discussion, but if a confrontation between two parties
  arises, the Scene becomes an Encounter.

  Encounters occur over a number of Rounds. Within each round, Characters are given an opportunity
  to act.

  ## Surprise
  If there is a chance either side could be Surprised about the Encounter, everyone rolls a d6
  before the first round to determine if they are. On a roll of a 1 or 2 a character is surprised
  and cannot act in the first round.

  ## Initiative
  Characters who are not surprised roll a d6 modified by Dex to generate their Initiative score.
  Participants act in order of Initiative from highest score to lowest, with PCs winning ties
  against NPCs and resolving ties amongst themselves as they see fit.

  ## Character Turns
  On their turn a Character may Move and take an Action.

  If a Character is Encumbered during an Encounter, their movement is halved, their AC is reduced
  by 1, and they lose any positive Dex modifiers.

  There are two special types of Actions that Characters often perform during Encounters, Talking
  with the other side and Attacking them.

  ## Talking
  Characters may spend their Action attempting to talk and perhaps reason, bargain, or parlay with
  the other side. The first time a Player Character does this during an encounter, they get to make
  a Reaction roll using 2d6 modified by Cha. The higher the number the less negative the reaction.

  ## Attacking and Combat
  When talking won‚Äôt do, Characters can attack. If a Character makes an Attack during an Encounter
  it becomes a Combat.

  Attacks are made by rolling a d20 modified by Str for melee or Dex for ranged attacks. Other
  modifiers may apply, such as +2 for sneak attacks made on unsuspecting targets. If the roll is
  equal to or over the opponent‚Äôs AC, the Characters hits and does Damage.

  ### Damage
  A successful Attack does at least 1 Damage to an opponent's HP. The Attacker rolls based on
  their weapon's Damage. Melee Attack Damage is modified by Str.

  ## End of Round
  After all Characters have had their turn, the Referee determines what happens next.

  ### Morale Checks
  If a group of Non-Player Characters has taken their first casualty or lost half of their
  members, they need to make a morale check. This is done by rolling 2d6 and comparing it against
  their morale score. A failed morale check results in the group surrendering or fleeing.

  ### Ending an Encounter
  If one side has been defeated or tensions have been de-escalated, the Encounter ends.
  Otherwise, another round begins, starting with the roll for Initiative.

The Arts of Illusion and Enchantment/Charm comprise the Form of Deceit and all
its splendor.

Practitioners of this somewhat sinister Form are capable of twisting others
perceptions of the world around them and their very thoughts. Though some use
the power of Deceit for good, it is no small wonder that Practice is frowned
upon by many.

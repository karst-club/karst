      <h1>What is Karst?</h1>
      <p>
        <em>
          A downtempo post-apocalyptic role playing game with themes of
          adventure, exploration, and soft terror.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Karst is a way to create stories. This site contains the rules and
        setting of Karst, stories that have been created with it, and perhaps
        some notes about how and why this all came to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some day we may create more tools for creating stories and put them here
        as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        We highly encourage you to create, share, and even publish your own
        stories, rules, and source material for Karst.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do end up wanting to publish things that use the Karst setting,
        we have a couple of guidelines that are linked to below.
      </p>
      <p>

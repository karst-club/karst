title: Notes for Players
---

Playing Karst is a straightforward affair, but there is more to the game than just the rules. What follows are a number of notes about playing, both as a character and as a group. Included within these notes are a few ideas and suggestions. They can—and should—be modified to fit your group's tastes and preferences.

## Motivation and Goals

As a player in the game, you have two goals. The first one is pretty obvious: your role is to embody one of the story’s protagonists. The second goal—which is just the second rule of the game, repeated for effect—is to serve the story. Notably, this may sometimes mean going against your first goal; there will be times when the story is better served by your character not getting what they want. During play, it can be easy to think of the Narrator as being the opposition, but this is not the case. In the moment, they may be against you, but in the end, you are playing together.

There will also be times when the motivations of different characters are opposed, and this is good; some of the most interesting and fun stories come from casts of characters that don't always get along. What matters most, however, is that you as players (and the narrator) are enjoying the story. Some groups may enjoy a lot of drama between characters, while others might prefer playing as a unified team. Above all else, it's about how you, as a group, want to play the game. Before you get started, talk to your fellow players about how you want to approach the game together. Likewise, be sure to let the narrator know your preferences.

## Embodying a Character

On paper, characters are nothing more than a few abilities, knacks, and items, plus a background and a name. In your hands, they become something more. Within these rules, each ability, knack, and item, is nothing more than a few words and a modifier. Again, through your actions and imagination, these traits can become more: a part of the shared language of storytelling.

Abilities tell the story of a character’s innate talents. What kind of folk a character is may speak to the perspectives they were raised with. Knacks can illustrate how a character has spent their time, the lessons they have learned and skills they have gaining. Items, too, may even give some indication of a character’s origins and backstory.

Less concretely, but no less important, a character’s background is the thread that weaves it all together; allowing each knack and ability to stand out as part of a woven whole; the why behind each what.

When playing, always keep your characters talents and background in mind. Think not of what modifiers you might add to a roll, but of what your character—with their particular knacks, abilities, and experience—would do in a given situation. Abilities are strengths; knacks are trained habited: things that a character should play to—at times to a fault.

## Journaling & Storytelling

Karst is a game about discovery and memories. Adventures recorded as entries in diaries, characters embodied as sketches in journals, recovered loot carefully noted down in ledgers and log books, hand-drawn maps of islands charted: all chapters in the story of what once was. The Karst Archipelago is now gone and forgotten; these fragments are all remain of its memories.

As you play, you will discover new stories and memories—and if you want, you can make plans to keep them. Some of the roles described below can assist in this endeavor, but it is up to you, together as a group or as an individual, to see it through.

## Playing as a Party

Unless you are but one, playing together as a party is an important part of the game. Parties and players can operate more efficiently when they designate and delegate certain tasks. This can also have the benefits of making things simpler for the narrator.

Depending on the size and needs of the group, some or all of the following roles may be worth assigning to certain players or characters. It's up to you if you want the players or their actual characters to be the ones performing the roles, and whether or not they rotate between chapters and stories. Remember: not every group will need every role.

### Mapper

Karst is a game about discovery. Having someone map where you are going and where you have been while you are out in the wilderness, diving into caves, or even navigating a town, can prevent you from getting lost and help you find your way back again. Besides, there is a simple joy in creating maps of imaginary places.

### Journalist

Karst is a game about memories. Keeping a diary or log of the things that have occurred can make it a lot easier to pick up where the group left off in between sessions and is also a wonderful post-game memento. In fact, a diary can be a great way to turn a game of Karst into a short story or novella, if you want to share your adventure with others and add to the broader tale of the archipelago. Much of the motivation that led to Karst came from the desire to have a system that lent itself to written storytelling in the form of character journals.

Of course, documenting a game takes time, and it is not for everyone. There is absolutely no requirement that you write anything down; Karst can be enjoyed without any amount of journaling whatsoever.

### Bookkeeper

Whether or not you want to map or record your adventures, every group needs some kind of shared ledger or inventory—and it can help to have an appointed bookkeeper maintain it. Unless your group instantly divides everything—rewards and obligations—you are going to have a few shared items, treasures, and concerns, that _someone_ will need to keep track of. If you’re really lucky, you might even have a whole ship to worry about.

### Lead

Not all groups need or even want a Lead, but larger parties may find them invaluable. The lead does not control the party, but acts as their chief representative. They describes to the narrator what the group is doing—especially during scenes of exploration—while making sure to step back and give the other players an opportunity to chime in when it is their characters’ time to shine. If your group decides to have a lead, it os worth first having a conversation about: who this will be, if the role will rotate, how the lead will make space for others, and how others should go about giving feedback if they feel that the role isn’t working.

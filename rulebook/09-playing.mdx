Playing Karst is a straightforward affair, but there is more to the game than rules alone. What follows are a number of notes about playing, both as a character and as a group. Included within these notes are a few ideas and suggestions. They can, and should, be modified to fit your group's tastes and preferences.

## Motivation and Goals

As a player in the game, you have two goals. The first one is pretty obvious: your role is to embody one of the story’s protagonists. The second goal – which is just the second rule of the game, repeated for effect – is to serve the story. Notably, this may sometimes mean going against your first goal; there will be times when the story is better served by your character not getting what they want. At times, it can be easy to think of the Narrator as being the opposition, but this is not the case. In the moment, they will be against you, but in the end, you are playing together.

There will also be times when the motivations of different characters are opposed, and this is good; some of the most interesting and fun stories come from casts of characters that don't always get along. What matters most, however, is that you as players (and your narrator) are enjoying the story. Some groups may love a lot of drama between their characters, while others might enjoy playing as a unified team. Above all else, it's about how you, as a group, want to play the game. Before you get started, talk to your fellow players about how you want to play together.

## Storytelling

Karst is a game about discovery, and memories. Adventures written as entries in diaries, characters embodied as sketches in journals, records of loot carefully noted down in ledgers and log books, hand-drawn maps of islands and caves: chapters in the story of what once was. The Karst Archipelago is now gone and forgotten; these books are all that remain of its memories. As you play, you will discover new stories and memories – and if you want, you can make plans to keep them.

Everything in Karst beyond these rules is presented as a book or other written record. An optional – but highly encouraged – part of the game is adding your stories to this canon. Some of the roles described below can explicitly assist in this endeavor, but it is up to you, together as a group or as an individual, to see it through.

## Playing as a Party

Unless you are a solo player, playing together as a party is important. Parties and players can operate more efficiently when they designate and delegate certain tasks. This also has the benefits of making things easier for the narrator.

Depending on the size and needs of the group, some or all of the following roles may be worth assigning to certain players or characters. It's up to you if you want the players or their actual characters to be the ones performing the roles, and whether or not they rotate between chapters and stories.

### Mapper

Karst is a game about discovery. Having someone map where you are going and where you have been while you are out in the wilderness, diving into caves, or even navigating a town, can prevent you from getting lost and help you find your way back again. Besides, there is a simple joy in creating maps of imaginary places.

### Journalist

Karst is a game about memories. Keeping a diary or log of the things that have occurred can make it a lot easier to pick up where the group left off in between sessions. It also makes for a great post-game memento. In fact, a diary can be a great way to turn a game of Karst into a short story or novella, if you want to share your adventure with others and add to the broader tale of the archipelago.

Much of the motivation that led to Karst came from the desire to have a system that lent itself to written storytelling in the form of character journals. Of course, documenting a game takes time, and it is not for everyone. There is absolutely no requirement that you write anything down; Karst can be enjoyed without any amount of journaling whatsoever.

### Bookkeeper

Whether or not you want to map and record your adventures, every group needs some kind of shared ledger or inventory – and it can help to have an appointed bookkeeper maintain it. Unless your group instantly divides everything – loot and obligations – you are going to have a few shared items, treasures, and concerns, that _someone_ will need to keep track of. If you’re really lucky, you might even have a whole ship to worry about someday.

### Lead

Not every group needs or wants a Lead, but larger parties may find them invaluable. The lead does not control the party, but acts as their chief representative. They describes to the narrator what the group is doing – especially during scenes of exploration – while making sure to step back and give the other players opportunities to chime in when it’s their character's time to shine. If your group decides to have a lead, it’s worth first having a conversation about: who this will be, if the role will rotate, how the lead will make space for others, and how others should go about giving feedback if they feel like the role isn’t working.

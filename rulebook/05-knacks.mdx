title: Knacks
---

Knacks are the central element of character development and specialization in Karst. They are the talents that make characters unique, along with their abilities and background. Every character begins with three knacks and develops three more with each additional level of experience. As characters grow and develop certain prerequisites, they gain access to more powerful and specialized knacks.

There are four categories of knacks:

- **Core** knacks represent specific talents that can grow with experience. They may be developed as frequently as once per level.
- **Odd-level** knacks are magical talents and gifts. They may be developed up to five times each, once for every odd-numbered level of experience a character has reached.
- **Basic** knacks are extraordinary talents. Each may be developed once.
- **Expert** knacks build on top of basic ones. Each may be developed once, but only after a character has reached the sixth level of experience and developed any prerequisite knacks.

<br />

The knacks listed here are meant to be a representative list. If you feel that any knacks are missing, you can add them. With a little work it is easy enough to convert abilities from other games or turn your own ideas into new knacks.

## Core Knacks

Core knacks are a central form of progression. Each of these five knacks improves a character in one specific dimension. Compared to basic, expert, and odd-level knacks, this may seem wanting, but their strength is found from the effect of repeat selection.

Core knacks may be developed as often as once per level: a maximum of ten times. Clever and very clever characters must develop a core knack twice or thrice to start. Because of this, their maximum limit for that specific knack rises to eleven or twelve, respectively.

### Vitality

You can survive what life throws at you.

_Gain three health._

### Focus

Your aim is true, even in the heat of battle.

_Add one to all attack rolls._

### Agility

You are a deft and elusive target.

_Add one to defense, unless completely restrained._

### Reaction

You are fast on your feet.

_Add one to all turn order rolls._

### Memorization

You have the mind and will for magic.

_You can memorize and cast one spell that you know per day._

## Odd-level Knacks

Magical gifts are represented by the odd-level knacks. These knacks are mystical paths of growth that a character may dabble in or follow to mastery. Like core knacks, they may be developed multiple times; but unlike core knacks, they may only be developed five times each, once for every odd-numbered level of experience that a character has reached – hence the name.

Another way in which odd-level knacks differ from core knacks is that each level of development may have different effects. In this regard, certain odd-level knacks are closer to basic and expert knacks, but with more levels of progression. As they are the most uncommon talents, once a game has begun, it may be difficult for a character to learn a new odd-level knack without the right teacher.

### Banishing

Your will can turn back spirits, corpsefolk, and other magical beings.

_You may banish nearby magical beings as an action, dealing one six-sided dice of damage for each level you have developed this knack. These dice may be split between one or more targets._

### Channel Essence

An agonizing power, you have learned to channel a small bit of your own life essence into a bolt of pure energy.

_You may channel your essence at a nearby target as an action, rolling up to one six-sided dice of damage for each level you have developed this knack. For each dice you choose to roll this way, lose one health._

### Deceit

It whispered. You listened.

_You have learned to speak Deceit’s Lies. For each level you that have developed this knack, you gain knowledge of another level of these spells._

### Healing Hands

Through your hands or paws courses the will of the gods, mending that which is broken.

_For each level you have developed this knack, you may heal six points of damage per day from yourself or another character that you are touching. This healing may be divided across multiple targets, actions, and scenes._

### Luck

Your will is fortunate.

_Once per day, you may re-roll a single roll of the dice, taking the new result instead. Additional levels grant additional daily re-rolls, but you may not re-roll the same roll twice._

### Song

Some folk sing with a most peculiar voice – you are one of them.

_Each time you develop this knack, choose one first level spell from any magical tradition. Once per day, you may sing as an action to cast this spell. During an altercation, it takes two uninterrupted actions across two turns to cast a spell in this way._

### Fists of Will

Be it by the Will of the Gods, the Spirits, or the strength of your own soul, your fists are imbued with a supernatural energy.

_You roll for damage when attacking without a weapon, rather than doing a single point of damage. The type of dice you roll is dependent on the number of times you have developed this knack, starting with a four-sided dice at the first level and increasing by two sides per level, up to a twelve-sided dice the fifth time the knack is developed._

### Spiritism

In service or in servitude, the spirits guide you.

_You have been granted the spirits’ Guidance. For each level you that have developed this knack, you gain knowledge of another level of these spell._

### Thaumaturgy

You study the Essence of Existence.

_You learned to perform thaumaturgical Transformations. Each time you develop this knack you discover the next level of these spells._

### Theurgy

The Gods Above are dead, but their will still lights your faith.

_You work Miracles. Each time you develop this knack you learn to perform the next level of these wonderous spells._

## Basic Knacks

Basic knacks represent the broadest group of talents. Each one confers some sort of special ability or bonus, but also represents an important personal aspect of the character who has developed it.

While each basic knack is different, many are complimentary and when taken together, or with other types of knacks, they can really shape a character. Every basic knack is also a prerequisite for one or more expert knacks, providing a manner of future progression.

### Weapon Training

You have trained hard with a specific kind of weapon.

_Choose one kind of weapon. You add one to attack and damage rolls with all weapons of this kind. This knack may be taken once for each kind of weapon._

### Shield Training

You have learned to use a shield effectively, without hindrance.

_You no longer subtract two from attack rolls when using a Shield. As an attack, you may perform a shield bash, which momentarily stuns the target or does a four-sided dice of damage if it hits._

### Archery

You are one with your bow, especially with time to take aim.

_You may spend a round aiming at a target with your bow before attacking. If you do so, you may choose to add four to either your attack or damage roll if the attack succeeds._

### Heavy Armor Training

Even in bulky armor you move with grace.

_You are hindered by heavy armor as if it were only medium armor. Due to their smaller size, lagartos may not develop this knack unless they are strong._

### Large Weapon Training

Other folk may find large weapons unwieldily, but not you.

_You may wield large weapons without penalty. Due to their smaller size, Lagartos may not develop this knack unless they are strong._

### Dual Wielding

You find comfort with a weapon in each hand or paw.

_You add one to all attacks when wielding two weapons. If the two weapons do different amounts of damage, roll a dice to randomly determine which weapon hits._

### Backstab

Anyone can stab someone else in the back – you’ve made an art of it.

_You quadruple instead of double your damage rolls for any dagger attacks made against unsuspecting targets._

### Deftness

You are so quick on your feet that armor only weighs you down.

_You gain two defense when unarmored._

### Savage Strike

Your blows are particularly violent.

_You add one damage to all attacks._

### Adversorcery

Your relationship with magic is an uncomplicated one: you despise, distrust, or disbelieve in it so much that it actually has trouble affecting you.

_You roll to resist the effects of all spells, not just the lies of Deceit. Add one to these rolls. The bonus granted to Wise characters does not apply to spells other than Lies._

### Alertness

You can sense danger before it strikes.

_You are less likely to be surprised by the start of an altercation, adding two to surprise rolls. Lagartos possess a natural version of this knack and may develop its related expert knack as a basic knack, instead._

### Bravery

Fear is just another enemy to be conquered.

_You are unaffected by Fear spells and similar effects. You add one to all morale roles._

### Clear-Eyed

You can see through many of Deceit’s simpler lies.

_You are unaffected by Charm and Sleep spells._

### Fitness

You have an excellent constitution.

_The effects of most poisons and disease are minimal to you. Add two to any resistance rolls against them._

### Animosity

Your dislike of a particular group is so great that it translates into righteous fervor.

_Choose one group to despise. You add one to any roll made against them. A group may be a type of folk, the residents of a specific place, a type of beast, or any other reasonable grouping of characters. This knack may be taken multiple times for multiple groups but does not apply multiple times to characters who belong to more than one group._

### Fury

Conflict brings out something within you.

_During an altercation, you may enter a furious trance at will, or automatically if you become wounded. During this trance, you add two to all attack and damage rolls, but may not perform any action other than charging towards the nearest foe and attacking them. You can not leave this state until the altercation has ended or you are reduced to two health or less. After a furious trance, you must rest for a short while, subtracting two from all rolls until you do so._

### Stealth

Your hands are light, your footsteps soft – the shadows are your home.

_You are skilled at avoiding detection and add two to any rolls to do so._

### Climbing

Walls, cliffs, if it has a few finger holds, you can climb it.

_You are able to climb all but the most sheer surfaces, adding two to any rolls to do so. Eekhorn possess a natural version of this knack and may develop its related expert knack as a basic knack, instead._

### Tumbling

There is an art to falling – a form of grace, even.

_You suffer far less damage from falling and are not stunned by being knocked over. Unless the distance is very great and there is nothing you can use to catch yourself, the most damage that you will take from a fall is half of your remaining health._

### Technically Minded

Contraptions, mechanisms, fulcrums, levers, causes and effects: you understand how these things operate – and how they can be used in unintended ways.

_You are able to understand and operate most kinds of mechanisms, including locks and small traps, adding two to any rolls involving them._

### Identify Substances

Poison or salve, causative or cure: distinctions you have learned to discern… with a bit of study.

_You can identify most common and some uncommon poisons, potions, and similar substances with a bit of study, adding two to any roll to do so._

### Reading

There are many written languages in the archipelago; you can muddle your way through a surprising number of them.

_You can read, or at least partially read, most modern writing. Add two to any rolls to decipher more esoteric scripts, as long as they were still written by folk._

### Combat Casting

The chaos of battle doesn’t phase your focus; you may cast spells even under duress.

_You may cast spells even while wearing light armor or having been wounded previously in the round._

### Sense Magic

You have a preternatural sense for the supernatural.

_You sometimes have a chance of passively detecting the presence of magic. When you actively attempt to detect the presence or nature of magical effects, add two to the roll._

### Natural Knowledge

Some are versed in lore of nature – you are steeped in it.

_You know much about the plants, animals, and natural phenomena around you. Add two to any rolls to identify plants, animals, weather patterns, or similar._

### Friend to Animals

You have a deep connection with the beasts and birds.

_You are able to calm and even tame most animals. You add two to any roll to calm an animal. If the roll is a six on the dice, you may instead tame the animal – a process that takes a number of hours or even days, depending on the nature of the beast._

### Hunting

You can usually find a meal.

_You know how to track prey and kill or capture quarry, adding two to any rolls to do so._

### Navigation

Whether charting the sea or wandering the earth, you are not one to get lost.

_You add two to any rolls for navigating across land or sea._

## Expert Knacks

Expert knacks represent advanced levels of skill and discipline, ones that are built upon basic knacks. These knacks may only be developed by characters who have reached the sixth level or higher. Each expert knack also has one or more prerequisite knacks that must be first be developed (and not at the same time).

Many of these knacks are effectively the second level of a basic knack, but others represent completely new disciplines or the pairing of two basic knacks into something more than either alone. As they may only be developed by characters who have reached high levels of experience, fewer characters possess these knacks; those who do may find their skills in demand.

_Soon._

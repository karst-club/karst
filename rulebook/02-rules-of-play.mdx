title: Rules of Play
---

_Karst is played as a shared dialog between the players and narrator._ These rules provide a framework for how that dialog is conducted and how dramatic situations can be resolved using creativity and chance.

## The Two Rules

In truth, there are only two rules to the game of Karst—the rest are mere suggestion.

_The first rule is to be reasonable._ There are many places in between the rules as written and the stories you tell that have been left up to your taste and judgment. It is assumed that you will approach these areas with good faith, whether as a player or narrator. Where there are unspoken rules and uncertainty in the text, search not for loopholes, but apply common sense rulings instead. Better still, view these gaps as opportunities to incorporate the ideas that fit the needs of your game and story.

_The second rule—which builds heavily upon the first—is to serve the story._ The goal of the game is not for one party or another to “win”, but for you to tell a story together. No matter your role in the telling, it is your objective to nurture the narrative and help it along, adding your own marks in the process.

In a sense, these two rules are one: Karst is played together.

# Stories

From short adventures in an evening’s time, to sagas played out over months or years, _the game of Karst is about creating stories._ Stories may be singular or made up of many chapters; part of something larger, or with smaller tales inside.

There are many shapes to stories, but almost all have a beginning and end—though neither may be obvious, especially to begin. The narrator may have the start of a plot, or things may be open ended; the conclusion of one story may be the beginning of another. Stories are yours to weave however you like.

## Scenes

No matter how else they are formed, _stories are made up of Scenes._ These are the events and interactions that matter to the players and their understanding of the story; in almost all scenes, a player’s character is present.

_A scene is a dialog._ It typically begins with the narrator describing a situation. Next, the players ask the narrator any questions they might have about the scene, or state any actions that their characters are taking.

The narrator answers questions as they see fit and describes the outcome of character actions, noting how the scene has changed as a result. If there are other characters or creatures in the scene, the narrator describes their actions, too.

This continues back and forth until the scene reaches a conclusion, transitioning to another scene or ending the current chapter of the story.

# Actions

_If a player wants their character to do something, they say so; this is called an Action._

**Actions generally happen.**

The narrator narrates the result of the action or invites the player to do so. Sometimes, the narrator will determine that the character has failed or is unable to perform the action, describing instead the failure.

**Creative player actions should almost always be rewarded by the narrator.** This encourages emergent storytelling and player engagement more than anything.

## Action Rolls

_When the narrator can’t decide the outcome of an action, they can call for a roll of the dice to determine what happens. This is called an Action Roll._

**Action rolls are the core mechanic of Karst.**

_To make an action roll, the player or narrator rolls a six-sided dice. If the roll is a six or higher, the action is a success. Otherwise, it is a failure._ There are often modifiers, which can add to or subtract from the roll, but if the dice shows a one, the action ends in failure. Similarly, if the dice shows a six, the action is successful.

**Action rolls can be used for many purposes.** When a horrible thing is about to happen to a character, a roll can sometimes be made to avoid some or all of the effects; this is known as a reaction roll. Opposed contests, too, can be handled using action rolls: both parties make an action roll and then compare the results to see if one side prevails.

When the outcome of an action roll would not be immediately apparent to the player performing it, the narrator may roll in secret, revealing the result when appropriate.

**An important note about action rolls is that they should be used sparingly.**

Players are meant to be rewarded for their creativity, characters are capable folk, and rolls are not made just for the sake of rolling dice. Limiting action rolls to the big moments in a game also makes their outcomes more memorable and impactful. That said, it is your game to play; if you like rolling dice for every action, go for it.

# Altercations

Scenes are generally free-flowing discussions, but there are also tense moments when the order in which characters act becomes vitally important. _When some form of confrontation arises between characters, the scene becomes an Altercation._ A slightly more structured procedure for handling actions, altercations can also be used at other moments of dramatic tension within a story.

## Rounds & Order

_An altercation is made up of successive Rounds._ During a round, each character is given a Turn to act. To determine the order of action in each round, every character involved must first determine their order score; this is done by way of an order roll.

At the beginning of the round, each player with a character in the altercation rolls a six-sided dice, often with modifiers. The narrator does the same for others involved.\_

_Going from the highest score to the lowest, each characters takes their turn._ Those with the same score act simultaneously.

Altercations sometimes start in surprising manners. _If there is a chance that a character would be caught unaware by the beginning of an altercation, they must first succeed at an action roll—known as a surprise roll—or they will be surprised and unable to act in the altercation’s first round._

## Turns

_On their turn, a character can take one action._ They may also walk a short distance or say a few words, but anything beyond that is an action itself.

Sometimes, a character may wish to do two things at once. If both of these actions are reasonable, one action is simpler than the other, and the character’s order score is at least four, the character can do so—but they must subtract three from their order score, acting later in the round as a result.

A character may not generally defer their action—they must act now or forfeit the opportunity. However, a character can prepare an action in response to a specific condition—which must be stated. If the condition occurs, so too does the action. Otherwise, at the start of the character’s next turn the action is effectively lost.

# Attacks

Altercations often turn violent. In these situations—or any other time that someone wishes to do harm—_a character can use their action to Attack a target._ This target may be another character or an inanimate object.

_To attempt an attack, the player or narrator rolls a twenty-sided dice. They succeed if the result is equal to or above the target’s Defense._ Attack rolls often have modifiers based on the participants and the situation at hand, but no matter the modifiers, or the target’s defense, an attack always succeeds on a roll of twenty and always fails on a roll of one.

## Damage

_A successful attack does Damage to the target._ Damage is not the only effect that an attack may have, but all attacks do at least one damage—even unarmed ones. For armed attacks, the amount of damage is based on the weapon being used. When a target is unaware of an attack, the damage is doubled. _Once the damage has been determined, it is subtracted from the target’s health; next, any other effects of the attack are resolved._

_If a character’s health is reduced to zero or less, they are immediately knocked-out of the altercation._ Similarly, an object that is damaged enough will break or be destroyed. More information about health and the consequences of losing it are outlined below.

# Resolution

_At the end of each round, the narrator determines if the altercation should continue._ If one side has been defeated, that’s the end of things, but there are other reasons why an altercation might end—some more peaceful than others.

The end of an altercation may return the action to the scene at hand, or it may transition the game to a new scene or chapter in the story. In some cases, the resolution of an altercation can even conclude the story—tragically or heroically.

# Injury & Death

The consequences of action are sometimes physical. A character’s health is an abstract representation of their well-being, stamina, fortitude, and resolve—maybe even their luck. As health is lost, the closer a character comes to a breaking point.

A character who has lost some of their health is harried and perhaps lightly wounded—nothing that can’t be cured by a warm meal and bit of rest—but those who have lost all of their health are in trouble. To begin with, _a character that has lost all health is knocked unconscious for the rest of the encounter._ Worse, they are seriously wounded and have a good chance of dying, especially if left unattended.

_Immediately after being reduced to zero health or less, a character must make a Death Roll. This is done by rolling a six-sided dice and subtracting any negative health from the result. If the result is one, the character has died._ If the result is a six or above, modified or on the dice, the character is wounded but will survive. Any other result is inconclusive; the character remains at death’s door and must roll again at the end of the next round.

_A character can use an action to attempt to administer aid to a seriously wounded character, making a death roll for them._ A success roll has the same effect as if the injured character had succeeded, but a roll of one will only reduce the target’s health by one more, rather than outright killing them.

## Recovery

Characters who have lost some of their health have various ways of regaining it. _A hot meal and a good night’s sleep will restore all lost health,_ but there are other methods when one is in a pinch for time.

_Sitting down for an hour and eating a meal is an effective pick me up. Any character that does this regains three health._ This can be done up to twice a day, beyond which is a waste of time and food.

Magical spells, abilities, and potions are often the fastest way of restoring lost health, but also the most scarce. Some magical effects are even capable of temporarily increasing health beyond its maximum value.

_A character who has lost all of their health but succeeded at a death roll must recuperate before adventuring again._ After being carried back to safety and shelter, they must spend at least a full week in bed. Once recuperated, a character is restored to full health, but may have some kind of permanent scar or injury.

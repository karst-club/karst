title: Items

Items enable character actions. Identity, too, is often wound up in items. Stories are filled with character that are known more for the things they wear and the items they carry, than for who they are.

## About Items

Anything that can be worn, manipulated or used in the hands or paws of a character is considered an item. Broadly, all items are one of three kinds: Common, Special, and Magical.

Most items are of the common variety: these are the everyday tools, equipment, and clothes found throughout the archipelago. Some common items can be more difficult to find or make than others, but, otherwise, there is nothing remarkable about them. Remarkable or not, giving individual common items a little bit of personality is encouraged.

Special items, on the other hand, are just that: items which are unique, rare, or particularly important to the story. These are usually a specific copy of some type of common item, and can be treated as such; any details handled on a per-item basis.

Lastly, there are Magical items: these extra-special items have been imbued with some form of magical power and are subject to their own rules. Some magical items share identical powers and effects, but each one is unique.

## Using Items

There are different types of items: Weapons, Tools, Armor, Clothing, Equipment, and Gear; an item’s type determines how it can be used. Some items may be worn, while others can be wielded. All types of items may be carried, either in hand or paw, strapped to a belt, or inside of another item designed for the purpose.

Certain items are consumed with usage. Others are not inherently consumable, but may be used in a disposable manner. Lastly, no item is indestructible—anything can be broken with enough effort.

## Carrying Items

_Characters can carry five items, two of which can be held in hand or paw. This limit does not include clothing, armor, or a backpack._ Small items can be grouped together into bundles of five, which are treated as a single item for carrying purposes.

A character who is burdened with more items than the limit will become fatigued after only a few minutes. Those who are both strong and tough will persevere a little longer, becoming fatigued after an hour of carrying one or two items above the limit.

Some items that are heavier or bulkier than others. These items can slow down or otherwise hinder a character who carries, wears, or wields them, regardless of what else they are carrying.

## Coins

There are many currencies found within the Karst Archipelago, but there is only one denomination: the Coin. _No matter the currency, one coin (¢1) is worth as much as the next, and all coins are of a similar size and weight. For carrying purposes, a sack or pouch with up to ¢100 is considered a single item._

## Common Items

These are some of the most common items that characters may have use of in their adventures, as well as their typical costs.

### Armor & Clothes

Armor and clothing are both worn. A character can wear one suit of armor or one pair of clothes, as well as a backpack or a bag. A character can also wear a pair of shoes, a hat, a belt, a pair of gloves, and a reasonable amount of jewelry. None of these worn items count against the carrying limit.

Armor offers protection in the form of additional defense, but also hinders a character in some manner or another, depending on its bulk or class. These hindrances are cumulative; each class of armor suffers the hindrances of those before them:

- **Light** - Hinders spellcasting.
- **Medium** - Hinders climbing, sneaking, and other acrobatic actions.
- **Heavy** - Subtract two from attack rolls and one from all other rolls.

There are many kinds of clothing and armor; shields are not armor—they must be wielded—but serve a similar function, and so they are included here as well:

- Plain Clothes - ¢5.
- Artisans Clothes - ¢10, pockets to carry one additional item.
- Backpack - ¢25, carry three additional items.
- Leather Armor - ¢25, two additional defense, light.
- Chain Mail Armor - ¢50, four additional defense, medium.
- Banded Armor - ¢50, five additional defense, heavy.
- Carapace Armor - ¢100, six additional defense, heavy.
- Shield - ¢25, two additional defense, subtract two from attack rolls.

### Weapons & Ammunition

Weapons are meant to do harm. When used, they increase the amount of damage that an attack does. Wielding a weapon requires one free hand or paw, unless noted otherwise. Some weapons require ammunition to function, consuming it with each attack.

Some weapons and ammunition have specific attributes:

- **For** - Signifies which weapon(s) an ammunition can be used with.
- **Large** - These weapons are unwieldily; characters must subtract two from both order rolls and attack rolls made while using them.
- **Long** - This weapon is longer than most, allowing a character to attack from a little bit further away, such as behind another character or from cover.
- **Ranged** - These weapons are used to attack nearby and far away targets, subtracting four from attack rolls against the latter.
- **Small** - This item can be bundled in groups of five for carrying.
- **Throwable** - This weapon may be thrown at a nearby target.
- **Two-handed** - This weapon requires both hands or paws to use.
- **Uses** - Signifies which ammunition a weapon uses.

<br />

These are among the most common weapons:

- Staff - ¢5, four-sided damage dice, long.
- Sling - ¢5, four-sided damage dice, ranged, uses stones.
- Dagger - ¢10, four-sided damage dice, throwable, small.
- Club or Hatchet - ¢10, six-sided damage dice.
- Spear - ¢25, six-sided damage dice, long, throwable.
- Sword or Axe - ¢25, eight-sided damage dice.
- Big Sword or Axe - ¢50, ten-sided damage dice, two-handed, large.
- Bow - ¢25, six-sided damage dice, two-handed, ranged, uses arrows.
- Long Bow - ¢50, eight-sided damage dice, two-handed, large, ranged, uses arrows.
- Twenty Five Arrows - ¢5, for bows and big bows.
- Ten Stones - ¢0, for slings.

This list of is by no means complete, but covers most broad categories. When adding your own weapons, you may find it easiest to copy or adjust existing ones.

### Equipment & Gear

There are all sorts of items beyond weapons, clothes, armor, and ammunition, in fact, the majority of items are _not_ the ones listed above. Many of these other items are tools to be used in hand or paw, others are equipment to be worn; some gear can even require a bit of set up before use.

As with the lists of weapons, clothes, and armor, this is only a sampling of the equipment and gear that can be found throughout the Karst Archipelago:

- Pouch - ¢10, carry two items as one.
- Rope - ¢5, fifty foot length.
- Book - ¢25, empty or filled with words.
- Small Tent - ¢25, sleeps one, two uncomfortably.
- Large Tent - ¢100, sleeps five, eight uncomfortably.
- Wooden Pole - ¢5, ten feet long.
- Six torches - ¢10, each one burns for one hour.
- Lantern - ¢25, burns for six hours before it must be refilled with wax.
- Tool Kit - ¢25, hand tools for a specific craft or trade.

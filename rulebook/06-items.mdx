Items enable character actions. Identity, too, is often wound up in items. Stories are filled with character that are known more for what they carry or wear than any other details about who they are.

## About Items

Anything that can be worn, manipulated or used in the hands or paws of a character is considered an item, be it a magical sword filled with unimaginable power, or the branch of a tree, wrenched from the scenery itself.

All items are one of three kinds: Common, Special, or Magical.

Most items are of the common variety: these are the everyday tools, equipment, and clothes found throughout the archipelago. Some common items may be more difficult to find or make than others, but, otherwise, there is nothing remarkable about them. Remarkable or not, giving some common items a little bit of personality is encouraged.

Special items, on the other hand, are just that: items which are unique, rare, or particularly important to the story. These are usually a specific copy of some type of common item, and can be treated as such; any details handled on a per-item basis.

Lastly, there are Magical items: these extra-special items have been imbued with some form of magical power and are subject to their own rules. Some magical items may share the same powers and effects, but all are unique.

## Using Items

There are different types of items: Weapons, Tools, Armor, Clothing, Equipment, and Gear. An item’s type determines how it can be used.

Some items may be worn, while others can be wielded. All types of items may be carried, either in hand or paw, strapped to a belt, or inside of another item designed for the purpose.

Certain items are consumed with usage. Others are not inherently consumable, but may be used in a disposable manner. Lastly, no item is indestructible – anything can be broken with enough effort.

## Carrying Items

_Characters may carry five items, two of which may be wielded in hand or paw. This limit does not include clothing or armor._ Small items can be grouped together into bundles of five, which are treated as a single item for carrying purposes.

A character who is burdened with more items than these limits will become fatigued after only a few minutes. Those who are both strong and tough will persevere a little longer, becoming fatigued after an hour of carrying as many as two items above the limit.

Some items that are heavier or bulkier than others. These items may slow down or otherwise hinder a character who carries, wears, or wields them, no matter what else they are carrying.

## Coins

There are many currencies found within the Karst Archipelago, but there is only one denomination: the Coin. _No matter the currency, one coin (¢1) is worth as much as the next, and all coins are of a similar size and weight. For carrying purposes, a sack or pouch with up to ¢100 is considered a single item._

## Common Items

These are some of the items that characters may have use of in their adventures, as well as their typical costs.

### Armor & Clothes

Armor and clothing are both worn. A character may wear one suit of armor or one pair of clothes, as well as a backpack or a bag. A character may also wear a pair of shoes, a hat, a belt, a pair of gloves, and a reasonable amount of jewelry. None of these items worn count against carrying limits.

Armor offers protection in the form of additional defense, but also hinders a character in some manner or another depending on its bulk, or class:

- **Light** - Hinders spellcasting.
- **Medium** - Hinders climbing, sneaking, and other acrobatic actions.
- **Heavy** - Subtract two from attack rolls and one from all other rolls.

<br />

These hindrances are cumulative; each class of armor suffers the hindrances of those before them.

There are many kinds of clothing and armor, including:

- Plain Clothes - ¢5.
- Artisans Clothes - ¢10, pockets to carry one additional item.
- Backpack - ¢25, carry three additional items.
- Leather Armor - ¢25, two additional defense, light.
- Chain Mail Armor - ¢50, four additional defense, medium.
- Banded Armor - ¢50, five additional defense, heavy.
- Carapace Armor - ¢100, six additional defense, heavy.
- Shield - ¢25, two additional defense, subtract two from attack rolls.

Shields are not armor, but serve a similar function, and so they are included above.

### Weapons & Ammunition

Weapons are meant to do harm. When used – or, wielded – they increase the amount of damage that an attack does. Wielding a weapon requires one free hand or paw, unless noted otherwise. Some weapons require ammunition to function, consuming it with each attack.

Certain weapons and ammunition have specific attributes:

- **For** - Signifies which weapon(s) this ammunition may be used with.
- **Large** - These weapons are unwieldily; characters must subtract two from attack rolls made with them.
- **Long** - This weapon is longer than most, allowing a character to attack from a little bit further away, such as behind another character or from cover.
- **Ranged** - These weapons are used to attack nearby and far away targets, subtracting four from attack rolls against the latter.
- **Small** - This item may be bundled in groups of five for carrying.
- **Throwable** - This weapon may be thrown at a nearby target.
- **Two-handed** - This weapon requires both hands or paws to use.
- **Uses** - Signifies which ammunition this weapon uses.

<br />

These are the most common weapons:

- Staff - ¢5, four-sided damage dice, long.
- Sling - ¢5, four-sided damage dice, ranged, uses stones.
- Dagger - ¢10, four-sided damage dice, throwable, small.
- Club or Hatchet - ¢10, six-sided damage dice.
- Spear - ¢25, six-sided damage dice, long, throwable.
- Sword or Axe - ¢25, eight-sided damage dice.
- Big Sword or Axe - ¢50, ten-sided damage dice, two-handed, large.
- Bow - ¢25, six-sided damage dice, two-handed, ranged, uses arrows.
- Long Bow - ¢50, eight-sided damage dice, two-handed, large, ranged, uses arrows.
- Twenty Five Arrows - ¢5, for bows and big bows.
- Ten Stones - ¢0, for slings.

<br />

This list of is by no means complete, but covers most broad categories. When adding your own weapons, you may find it easiest to map them to existing ones.

### Equipment & Gear

There are all sorts of items beyond weapons, clothes, armor, and ammunition. Many of these are tools to be used in hand or paw, while others are equipment to be worn. Some gear may require a bit of set up before usage. As with the lists of weapons and armor, this is only a sampling of the kinds of equipment and gear that can be found throughout the Karst Archipelago:

- Pouch - ¢10, carry two items as one.
- Rope - ¢5, fifty foot length.
- Book - ¢25, empty or filled with words.
- Small Tent - ¢25, sleeps one, two uncomfortably.
- Large Tent - ¢100, sleeps five, eight uncomfortably.
- Wooden Pole - ¢5, ten feet long.
- Six torches - ¢10, each one burns for one hour.
- Lantern - ¢25, burns for six hours before it must be refilled with wax.

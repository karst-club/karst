Swords, shovels, books, tools, clothing, and coins: items enable character actions. Identity, too, is often wound up in items. Stories are filled with folk who are known more for what they carry and wear than any other detail about who they are.

## About Items

Anything that can be worn, manipulated or used in the hands or paws of a character is considered an item, be it a magical sword filled with unimaginable power, or the branch of a tree, wrenched from the scenery itself.

All items belong to one of three broad types: Common, Special, and Magical.

Most items are of the common type: these are the everyday tools, equipment, and clothes found throughout the archipelago. Some common items may be more difficult to find or make than others, but, otherwise, there is nothing remarkable about them. Remarkable or not, giving individual common items a little bit of personality is encouraged.

Special items, on the other hand, are just that: items which are unique, rare, or particularly important to the story. These are usually a specific copy of some kind of common item, and can be treated as such. Any details are handled per-item.

Lastly, there are Magical items: these extra-special items have been imbued with some form of magical power and are subject to their own rules. Some magical items may share the same powers and effects, but all are unique.

## Using Items

In addition to its type, each item is of a certain kind. These include: Weapons, Tools, Armor, Clothing, Equipment, and Gear. An item’s kind determines how it can be used.

Some kinds of items, such as armor, clothes, and backpacks, are worn. Others, such as weapons and tools, are wielded. All items may be carried, either in hand or paw, strapped to a belt, or inside of another item, such as a backpack or pocket.

_Characters may wear one set of clothing or armor and carry five items, two of which may be wielded in hand or paw._ This limit may be increased by wearing a backpack or carrying a sack. Small items can be grouped together into bundles of five, which are treated as a single item for carrying purposes.

A character burdened by too many items will become fatigued after a few minutes. Those who are both strong and tough will persevere a little longer, only becoming fatigued after an hour of carrying one or two more items than the limit. There are some items that are heavier or bulkier than others. These items may slow down or otherwise hinder a character who carries, wears, or wields them, no matter what else they are carrying.

Certain items are consumed with usage. Others are not inherently consumable, but may be used in a disposable manner. Lastly, no item is completely indestructible – anything can be broken with enough effort.

## Coins

There are many currencies found within the Karst Archipelago: from the Gilded Drams of the Floating Cities, and the Gold Cupos of the First Serpos Empire, to the common Union Crowns minted by the Guilds of the Eastern Woods – but there is only one denomination: the Coin. _No matter the currency, one coin (¢1) is worth as much as the next, and all coins are of a similar size and weight. For carrying purposes, a sack or pouch with up to ¢100 is considered a single item._

## Common Items

These are some of the most common items that characters will find and use on their adventures, as well as their typical costs.

### Armor & Clothes

Armor and clothing are both worn. A character may wear one suit of armor or one pair of clothes, as well as a backpack or a bag. A character may also wear a pair of shoes, a hat, a belt, a pair of gloves, and a reasonable amount of jewelry. None of these worn items count against carrying limits.

Armor, unlike clothing, offers protection in the form of additional defense, but also hinders a character in some manner or another, depending on how bulky it is:

- **Light** - Hinders spellcasting.
- **Medium** - Hinders climbing, sneaking, and other acrobatic actions.
- **Heavy** - Subtract two from attack rolls and one from all other rolls.

<br />

These hindrances are cumulative; each class of armor suffers the hindrances of the classes before them. Shields are not armor, but serve a similar function, and so they are listed together:

- Plain Clothes - ¢5.
- Artisans Clothes - ¢10, pockets to carry one additional item.
- Backpack - ¢25, carry three additional items.
- Leather Armor - ¢25, two additional defense, light.
- Chain Mail Armor - ¢50, four additional defense, medium.
- Banded Armor - ¢50, five additional defense, heavy.
- Carapace Armor - ¢100, six additional defense, heavy.
- Shield - ¢25, two additional defense, subtract two from attack rolls.

### Weapons & Ammunition

Weapons are used to do harm. They do this by increasing the amount of damage that a successful attack does. Wielding a weapon requires one free hand or paw, unless noted otherwise. Some weapons require ammunition to function, consuming it with each attack.

Certain weapons and ammunition have specific attributes:

- **For** - Signifies which weapon(s) this ammunition may be used with.
- **Large** - These weapons are unwieldily; characters must subtract two from attack rolls made with them.
- **Long** - This weapon is longer than most, allowing a character to attack from a little bit further away, such as behind another character or from cover.
- **Ranged** - These weapons are used to attack nearby and far away targets, subtracting four from attack rolls against the latter.
- **Small** - This item may be bundled in groups of five for carrying.
- **Throwable** - This weapon may be thrown at a nearby target.
- **Two-handed** - This weapon requires both hands or paws to use.
- **Uses** - Signifies which ammunition this weapon uses.

<br />

These are the most common weapons:

- Staff - ¢5, four-sided damage dice, long.
- Sling - ¢5, four-sided damage dice, ranged, uses stones.
- Dagger - ¢10, four-sided damage dice, throwable, small.
- Club or Hatchet - ¢10, six-sided damage dice.
- Spear - ¢25, six-sided damage dice, long, throwable.
- Sword or Axe - ¢25, eight-sided damage dice.
- Big Sword or Axe - ¢50, ten-sided damage dice, two-handed, large.
- Bow - ¢25, six-sided damage dice, two-handed, ranged, uses arrows.
- Long Bow - ¢50, eight-sided damage dice, two-handed, large, ranged, uses arrows.
- Twenty Five Arrows - ¢5, for bows and big bows.
- Ten Stones - ¢0, for slings.

<br />

This list of is by no means complete, but covers most broad categories. When adding your own weapons, you may find it easiest to map them to existing ones.

### Equipment & Gear

There are all sorts of items beyond weapons, clothes, armor, and ammunition. Many of these are tools to be used in hand or paw, while others are equipment to be worn. Some gear may require a bit of set up before usage. As with the lists of weapons and armor, this is only a sampling of the kinds of equipment and gear that can be found throughout the Karst Archipelago:

- Pouch - ¢10, carry two items as one.
- Rope - ¢5, fifty foot length.
- Book - ¢25, empty or filled with words.
- Small Tent - ¢25, sleeps one, two uncomfortably.
- Large Tent - ¢100, sleeps five, eight uncomfortably.
- Wooden Pole - ¢5, ten feet long.
- Six torches - ¢10, each one burns for one hour.
- Lantern - ¢25, burns for six hours before it must be refilled with wax.

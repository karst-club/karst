Karst is a role playing game inspired by the classics—new and old. It features simple rules, an emphasis on discovery, and a haunted archipelago filled with animal folk and terrible secrets.

_The object of the game is to create a story together._

Karst features a simple and flexible system of character customization. The rules are lightweight and easy to modify or use with other systems and content.

## Playing the Game

_To play, you will need a Narrator and one or more Players._ Each player acts as a character within the game world, while the narrator controls the world itself: setting the stage, describing it to the players, and determining how the world responds to the actions of their characters.

_In Karst, you will be talking and writing things down. Sometimes, you will roll dice._ Advice on how to conduct the game is sprinkled throughout these rules, but much is left up to you and your group. This includes almost all details and specifics about journaling your efforts—which is highly encouraged.

This text concerns itself mostly with guidance around when to roll the dice (rarely) and what things might affect those rolls. It also contains information to help you create characters and stories, as well as learn a little bit about the Karst Archipelago itself.

Additional books and pamphlets published by the **Karst Archipelago Historical Society** and others contain more information about the world of Karst. We sincerely hope you end up contributing to this body of work.

## Rolling the Dice

Karst does not have a huge emphasis on dice, but they are a useful tool for resolving uncertainty. As such, you will need a few six-sided dice and some fancier ones that have four, eight, ten, twelve, and twenty sides. It can be helpful if everyone has their own set.

_No matter what dice you are rolling, in Karst, a higher number is always better._

When rolling the dice there will often be modifiers, positive or negative. After rolling, adjust the result by adding or subtracting any modifiers. _A modifier may not bring the result of a roll below one._

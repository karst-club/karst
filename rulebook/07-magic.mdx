title: Magic
---

The Karst Archipelago is steeped in magic. From subtle illusions to overt transformations, the use of magic is not uncommon, though neither is it an everyday occurrence. There are four types, or traditions, of magic, each with its own connection to the cosmology of the world. They are Theurgy, Thaumaturgy, Spiritism, and Deceit.

When the Gods Above died in the creation of the world, their will became a part all things. To channel and manifest this will is known as Theurgy – a demanding path, whose faithful reward is the most direct and forceful type of magic.

All that is everything has been woven together into the Essence of Existence; Thaumaturgy is the art and science of its transformation. To understand the nature of this essence – and reshape it to one’s own desires – is the life work of every Thaumaturge – a study that is equal parts research and applied practice.

The reflections of the folk who came before are known as the Spirits Below. Practitioners of Spiritism seek their aid or do their bidding – often both. The spirits guide those who beseech them, soothing wounds and helping light the way. But their guidance, too, is sought by those with more vengeful desires – for it can also be used to do harm.

Though it whispers into every ear, none dare speak openly of Deceit. Few listen to its treacherous words, but those who would are soon versed in the tongue of Lies.
While it is the weakest form, no magic is as sinister – for Deceit has the power to shape the thoughts, perceptions, and even the emotions of others.

## Practicing Magic

A Practitioner of magic is any character who can cast spells. Strictly speaking, this means that they have developed at least one level of the Concentration knack. Practically speaking, there is little magic that can be done without knowing any spells to cast.

Spells are learned by becoming versed in a magical tradition. To do so, a character must develop a level in any of the four magical knacks – Deceit, Spiritism, Thaumaturgy, or Theurgy – granting them the knowledge of the equivalent level of that tradition’s spells (and those below it).

### Spell Casting

As an action, a practitioner may cast a spell. The effects of many spells are instantaneous and permanent, though others may grow with time or fade after a short while; each spell is unique.

A character may cast any spell they know, with two conditions: they may only cast as many spells per day as they have levels of concentration, and each spell may only be cast once in a day. For tracking, a “day” refers to the time a character goes between long periods of rest, such as sleeping.

The methods by which each practitioner casts their magic vary: be it through gestures, words, or simple thought. In all cases, the act of casting takes only an instant, but requires much concentration and focus. If a character is restrained, has already been attacked in the current round of an altercation, or is similarly harried, it is assumed that they are unable to concentrate well enough to cast a spell.

## Magical Powers

Certain magical items and knacks grant characters the ability to use spell-like powers. Using these powers typically requires an action, much like casting a spell, but with rules specific to the item or ability in question. Often, the effect of these powers are the similar to those of a specific spell, and will be describes as being so.

# Deceit

“Whispers and lies.”
The Lies of Deceit are impressive, but ultimately hollow. They are the weakest magic, unable to affect the physical plane and the Essence of Existence. Yet, they are also the strongest magic, for they can alter the perceptions of others, clouding their judgement; bending their very thoughts and will.

Unlike other spells, the target of a lie is always given a chance to see through it. Wise characters are particularly capable of seeing through lies and add one to any rolls to resist their effects. Some lies affect more than one target; if a character sees through the lie, the spell is broken for them but remains in place for the others.

## Level One - Deception

### Charm

A friendly smile and honied words.

_Target one nearby character. They must make an action roll to resist, or they will be charmed, serving you with the loyalty typically reserved for a close friend. The effects of this spell last for one day. If you charm the same target every day for a week, the effects last for a month._

### Fear

There is no feeling more primal.

_ Target one nearby character. They must make an action roll to resist, or they will become terrified, running away or cowering in abject fear for the next half hour._

### Sleep

Ask not what dreams are made of.

_ Target one nearby character. They must make an action roll to resist or they will fall asleep for at least one hour._

## Level Two - Illusion

### Hallucinations

The sense are easily fooled.

_You may create an illusion that lasts for one hour. This may include sights, sounds, smells, touch, and even taste, encompassing an area as large as a room. Everything within the illusion must be inanimate, though running water, fire, contraptions and other things that move without life are perfectly acceptable. A character who has reason to suspect the illusion may make an action roll to see through it._

### Paralyze

The mind is its own prison.

_Target up to three nearby characters. They must make an action roll to resist, or they become unable to move for the next ten minutes._

### Vanish

A lie of omission.

_You become invisible to other folk and creatures for one hour. Attacking or touching another character causes immediate detection. A character who has reason to suspect your presence may make an action roll to detect you._

## Level Three - Subterfuge

### Cloak of Shadows

The shadows grow long.

_This lie functions the same as Vanish but may be cast on up to three nearby targets, including oneself._

### Incite Mood

An aimless crowd and a touch of direction.

_By exhorting a group of folk, you may induce any simple emotion within them, such as joy or hatred. Target up to three nearby characters; for each target that fails to resist the effects, the effects spread to as many as three more nearby targets._

### Phantasm

The illusion comes to life.

_You may create an illusion in the form of any living being that you have encountered before. This illusion may attack other characters and has the same statistics as what it represents; however, the wounds it causes are illusory, though they may render a character unconscious. If a phantasm is struck, it will dissolve._

## Level Four - Treachery

### Dreamscape

A big lie.

_This lie functions in the same manner as Hallucinations, but can effect a much larger area, up to the size of a small field._

### Sway

Held in rapt attention.

_This lie function in the same manner as Charm, but may be cast on up to three nearby characters. For each target that fails to resist the effects, the effect spreads to as many as three more nearby targets._

### Terror

A spark in dry kindling.

_This lie functions in the same manner as Fear, but may be cast on up to three nearby character. For each target that fails to resist the effects, the effect spreads to as many as three more nearby targets._

## Level Five - Manipulation

### Permanent Illusion

A lie repeated.

_This lie functions in the same manner as Hallucinations, but its effect lasts indefinitely._

### Subjugate

Grasp the strings.

_ Choose one nearby character to subjugate. They must make an action roll to resist, or they fall under your complete control, compelled do anything you command. The effects of this spell last for one day. If you subjugate the same target every day for a week, the effects last for a month._

### Truth

A reason for the lies after all.

_You may remove the veil of lies from the eyes of another, allowing them to see the truth of existence. What particular effect this will have varies from individual to individual, but the end result is always the same: permanent insanity._

# Spiritism

“The spirits guide.”

Through Guidance the Spirits Below interact with the living. This guidance takes on countless forms – as many forms as there are spirits. Each practitioner’s relationship with the spirits differs, too. Some seek their aid, others seek to serve them. The true nature and goals of the spirits are known by few, but they are respected, if not revered, by most folk.

Many types of guidance are of a dual nature: able to help or harm. When a Spiritist memorizes one of these spells, they do not choose which form to memorize, but instead decide in the moment of casting.

## Level One - Empathy

### Tongues

Every tongue was once spoken.

_For the next hour, the caster or one target is able to read the text of all languages. Additionally, they may read any cipher whose author is dead. The caster adds two to any roll to understand ciphers whose author is still alive._

_Alternatively, one target is unable to read or understand anything spoken to them for the next hour, as the chatter of spirits fills their mind._

### Sense Essence

The view from Below.

_For the next hour, the caster is able to detect the presence of any nearby magical effects or powers. Lies and other means of Deceit are not automatically detected, but the caster adds one to any rolls to see through them._

_Alternatively, the caster may conceal the magical nature of any one character, item, or effect, hiding its nature for the next hour._

### Transference

A gift to buoy the living – or a curse to strike them down.

_You or one character that you can touch immediately gains or loses six health. If this brings a character from zero or less health to a positive value, they immediately recover from unconsciousness and can adventure again after a short rest._

## Level Two - Purpose

### Intention

The eyes of the past.

_The Spirits reveal to you the intentions of others. For the next hour, you may learn another character’s general feelings for you by looking them in the eye or or by being spoken to directly by them._

### Pathway

The spirits guide and the spirits hide.

_For the next hour, you are able to sense the general direction of your current goal. The more specific and detailed your knowledge of your goal, the more detailed and specific the guidance will be._

_Alternatively, you may cast this spell to conceal an object. For the next hour it will go unnoticed, unless if someone is explicitly looking for it, in which case they must make an action roll to do so._

### Share Thoughts

Of one mind.

_Choose yourself or a nearby character as a target. For the next hour, the target can mentally communicate with others. To begin communicating with another character, they must be nearby, but the communication may continue at a distance._

## Level Three - Revelation

### Curse

A pox upon them.

_Choose one nearby character. For the next month they subtract one from all rolls._

_Alternatively, remove a curse._

_Alternatively, you may afflict the target with a disease of your choice, but it must be one that you have previously cured._

See without sight.

_Choose one place where you have stood before. For the next hour, you may view that area as if you were standing there again._

A font of energy.

_You may restore up to thirty health, split between yourself and any nearby characters of your choice._

A questionable practice.

_You may animate up to three lifeless bodies or items for the next hour. They behave as Corpsefolk or similar, but under your control._

### Commune

A question answered.

_You may ask the spirits one question, receiving a truthful answer._

### Rejuvination

Some endings are premature.

_You may revive one character who has failed a death check within the past day, restoring them to full health after a few hours of rest._

# Thaumaturgy

“The gift of the Wind.”

The Thaumaturge studies the Essence of Existence, seeking to understand its ways and shape it to their desires. The great works of Thaumaturgy are known as Transformations. These precise and exacting spells change the very Essence of Existence, often pushing it to one extreme or another. More direct than some forms of magic, there is still a sublime grace to art and science of Thaumaturgy.

While it is claimed that Thaumaturgy was taught to folk by the wind itself, the modern teaching and practice is far more regimented than the other magical traditions. Many Thaumaturges have undergone a formal course of study at a school or university, or began their career as an apprentice. As a result, there are many competing schools of thought, academic rivalries, and theoretical disputes amongst the thaumaturgical community.

## Level One - The Apprentice

### Lumination

Light and shadow.

_Target one character, item, or piece of scenery, making it glow brightly or absorb nearby light, illuminating the area nearby or casting it into complete darkness. This effect lasts for one hour. If cast on the eyes of a character, they are blinded for the spell’s duration._

### Magnetism

Attraction and repulsion.

_Choose two targets, such as characters, items, or scenery. For the next hour they are either fused together or repel each other with great strength._

### Purity

Time and change.

%% todo make this a cubic meter of matter? (Minus living ofc)
_You may age or reverse the aging of up to a dozen meals’ worth of food and drink, making them edible or inedible in the process. This spell can be cast on a similar amount of any other lifeless matter, spoiling or purifying it._

## Level Two - The Student

### Levitation

Up and down.

_Target yourself, a willing character, or a nearby item. For the next hour the effects of gravity upon the target are replaced by your whims. The target may not be made to rise quicker than a fast walking speed or fall faster than the speed of gravity._

### Speak with Animals

Speak and squawk.

_For the next hour you may speak with any member of the animal kingdom. This ability does not make animals any more sympathetic to you, but most may be reasoned with, to a degree._

### Temperance

Hot and cold.

_Choose one nearby target, or yourself. The target is unaffected by changes in temperature for the next hour._

## Level Three - The Adept

### Flight

The gift of the Wind.

_For the next hour, you may ignore the effects of gravity and move in any direction, vertical or horizontal, at a fast walking speed._

### Quicken

Time inside time.

_Target yourself or one nearby character. For the next ten minutes, the target acts at twice their normal speed. During altercations they take two turns each round, rolling two dice when determining order and acting on each one._
%% Might need to add some words about no double quicken or fast casting

### Speak with Plants

The language of leaves.

_ For the next hour you may speak with any member of the plant kingdom. Most plants are forthright and relatively indifferent to folk; they will willingly share what they know, but will offer little in the way of assistance._

## Level Four - The Scholar

### Growth

More from less.

_Target yourself, another nearby character, or an item. The target instantly doubles in size and remains so for the next hour. Successful attacks by large characters do twice as much damage._

### Speak with the Wind

The words of the Wind.

_ For the next hour you may speak with the wind. Their words are never without insight, but they often speak in riddles. Help may be offered by or requested from them, but never without complication._

### Telekinesis

Mind over matter.

_For the next hour you may move inanimate objects and willing characters with your mind. At any given time you may control one target as if it were under the effects of the Fly spell._

## Level Five - The Master

### Blink

Here and there.

_You may instantly transport yourself to anywhere else that you have been before._

### Creation

Essence is abundance.

_You can create a simple handheld item or enough food and drink for up to a dozen meals out of thin air._

### Transmute

Everything is everything.

_Target yourself, another nearby character, or an item. The target instantly transforms into another character or item of your choosing, and remains so for the next hour._

# Theurgy

“The Will of the Gods.”

Faithful is the path of the Theurge – for devotion is the price that must be paid in exchange for the Miracles they are afforded. The Gods Above are dead, but their Will is very much alive and present in all things. It is harmony with this Will that the theurge seeks to find through their devotion. To live in accordance with their chosen gods – and to rid the world of the inharmonious – is their purpose and goal.

The miracles performed by the theurge are not subtle matters. These powers affect change; often in the most violent or direct manner possible.

## Level One - Observance

### Bolt

Righteous energy.

_Strike one nearby target for six damage._

### Shield

Will withstands trouble.

_Choose yourself, a nearby character, or an item. The target gains four defense for the next hour._

Faith.

_Choose up to three nearby targets, optionally including yourself. For the next hour the targets gain two to all attack rolls._

### Fate

Faith rewarded.

_You may cast this spell instantly before you or another character is about to roll the dice. Choose the result, rather than rolling for it._

### Shift

A sudden change in conditions.

_For the next hour you may change the nearby climate, increasing or decreasing the temperature, humidity, and perspiration._

## Level Five - Sanctity

### Eradicate

Opposition removed.

_Target one nearby character, immediately reducing their health to negative two._

### Servant of Will

Belief made manifest.

_Summon a Servant of Will to will follow your command for one hour._

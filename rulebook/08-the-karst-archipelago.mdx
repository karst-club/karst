title: The Karst Archipelago
---

Rising up in broken stillness from the placid Mirror Sea, the islands of the Karst Archipelago stand alone between the sea’s vast expanse and the Impossibly Blue Sky above.

It is said that long ago, the Three Distant Shores were one and there was no Mirror Sea, but in time they grew apart and so the sea was born. Whence came the archipelago—left behind or arisen since—matters little to most inhabitants. What does however, is that the three distant shores—the ancestral homelands of the archipelago’s folk—have seemingly vanished.

No ships have arrived from the Eastern Woods, the Western Sands, or the Southern Swamps in over a generation; few still cling to the hope that they ever will again. Already an independent lot, the folk of the archipelago have taken the isolation in stride.

Colonial outposts have become island states, while loose alliances of fishing villages have transformed into merchant kingdoms; but for each community that has flourished, an equal number have perished—or worse. Pirate dens have grown into cutthroat hives, while scores of villages and whole islands have fallen silent, abandoned or overrun.

## History

The known history of the Karst Archipelago begins hundreds of years ago. Save for a few small outposts of the First Serpos Empire, lagartos separatists arrived here first—bringing their spirits and superstitions, but quick to intermingle with the echos of those from before.

A few silent centuries. Then, the fall of the First Serpos Empire, bloated and corrupt. The veldings, a nation of refugees once oppressed and newly free, fled across the seas. Midway in their journey to the eastern woods lay the arichipelago, a stopover, and place to rest. Here many chose to stay, lured by warm sands and secluded shores. From these communities came another part of the archipelago’s culture, a mercantile and seaborne spirit.

Here and there, small outposts were established by merchants from lands afar, while a number of longtime communities became trading destinations of their own. Still, the archipelago remained something of an afterthought; it flourished and even thrived, but little changed.

And so life went on.

One day, no ships arrived from the three distant shores, but no one noticed. Nor did anyone notice when they did not arrive the next day, or the week after. No, it was not until one could no longer say how long it had been that anyone had cared to wonder—and by then, it was far too late to do anything about.

Some say the old doomsayers and fortune tellers at the edge of Orway were the first to catch on, and also the last to be listened to. The exact measure matters not; all that can be said is that it has been a generation since the three distant shores were last heard from in the Karst Archipelago.

## Life in the Archipelago

Isolated now from the three distant shores, life continues unchanged for many folk in the Karst Archipelago. Those who live in the villages and cities of the nation states and island kingdoms lead fairly mundane lives. The warm climate and the abundance of the sea provides for basic needs and most islands have some form of agriculture: orchards, vineyards, root crops, and fowl.

There is still some industry here and there, as well—even new ventures on the more prosperous islands—but many things remain in scarce supply. Trade is a vital conduit for many goods and the sea is filled with merchant vessels. Too, it is filled with pirates and other unscrupulous folk.

## Places

Much of the archipelago remains unexplored or recently forgotten, but some islands are known far and wide. These are but a few of the most recognized destinations in the archipelago.

### Belagoria

A prosperous merchant kingdom, Belagoria sits on the precipice of multiple disasters. Ever at odds with its rival, Golandra, hostilities between the two nations spiral now into outright warfare. At home, the peasants have begun to revolt against the wealthy excesses of the merchant families, as a dontler blight in Eastern Belagoria enters its third year. Lastly, the ground itself has begun to tremble beneath the capital; some fear—correctly—that major earthquake is due.

### Eektorp Bay

One of the busiest—and dirtiest—ports in the archipelago, Eektorp Bay is a maze of shipyards, docks, high roads, and back alleys—all choked with corruption and filth. Its ruler, the Duke, is a corpulent autocrat with an insatiable hunger for roast goose and honied dontlers. He rules Eektorp Bay and the slums of Hoveltun with a lazy, but iron, fist: going months without oppressing the citizenry, only to crack down on a whim; executing a handful of folk for some minor or completely arbitrary slight—real or perceived.

### Porta Cortu

Porta Cortu is a freeport: a loosely organized collection of communities packed onto four small islands. This nexus of merchants, adventurers, and excitement is the dizzying center of all trade and commerce in the Karst Archipelago; a perfect place for all kinds of tales.

### Thark

A kingdom known for its mighty warriors, Thark is a proud and insecure culture. The citizens of Thark praise honesty and forthright behavior; Deceit is shunned.
The folk are active; many engage in hunting, mountaineering, and other physical activities, while some seek glory in the ranks of the military, or as adventurers. The nation consists of two large and hilly islands as well as a number of smaller isles. The island of Thark Minora is the largest in the archipelago, its coastal hills leading up to snowcapped mountains. An unabashed monarchy—but non-hereditary; each successor is chosen and groomed—Thark is currently ruled by King Groedsun, a tall and jolly smoothskin visita, whose reign has been mostly benevolent.

title: Narrating
---

Narrators make the world of Karst come alive. The players and their characters are central to the plot, but it is the narrator who facilitates it all. If this is the role you are playing, you have a greater responsibility – and a potentially greater reward. This chapter aims to give you a few tips and tricks for handling these responsibilities while having an enjoyable time in the process.

## Creating Stories

Karst is a game about creating stories. The narrative will grow and evolve based on what the players do, but the foundation is up to you. Some players will want lots of initial plot to bite into, while others may want less.

For the former, consider sketching out an adventure with a strong core premise, a few general branches, interesting characters, and ideas for scenes or situations before you play. Start the game with a strong introductory hook to lure the players in. You might even tell the players a little bit about this hook if you want them to tailor their characters in any specific ways to fit the plot. Once the game has started, don’t be afraid to go in different directions than you had anticipated. Being flexible and responding to the actions and interests of the players will lead to the more enjoyable stories for everyone involved, rather than if you try and force a plot.

For a more open-ended experience, come up with a handful of adventure seeds, encounters, and interesting characters. To simplify this task, you may want to borrow ideas from different sources – perhaps using random generators and tables. Let the players create the characters they want, or encourage them to discover their characters’ backgrounds as they play. Finally, give them a way to start exploring, such as the beginning of a map or an actual method of transportation, like a boat. Often, an open-ended game will begin to focus on some kind of larger plot as time goes on. Don’t hesitate to start planning things out a little bit more if this begins to happen.

Combining the two types of gameplay, the beginnings of a large adventure could involve a small plot to acquire a vessel before the broader story begins.

## Themes

Broadly, there are two kinds of stories set in the Archipelago: ballads and requiems. Ballads are happy tales: stories of success and adventure in light, or in spite, of a dying world – rollicking songs to be sung around a warm fire. Requiems are more somber affairs: tales of tragedy, regret, and loss – more quiet and personal; perhaps a more natural fit for the setting. Some stories contain elements of each, while others are clearly one or the other.

The themes of the stories that you tell are up to you, but the setting does lend itself more to certain kinds of stories than others. Tales of adventure and exploration are the most obvious fit, as the archipelago is ripe for discovery. Complex, interpersonal tales and those of political intrigue, too, are a good match – especially when set in a busy port of call or other densely-populated areas.

Nautical themes abound, but they do not completely dominate; the larger islands of the archipelago are home to open plains and snowcapped mountains, places to get lost on land, rather than at sea. Unifying it all is a faint and resigned sense of unease – there is optimism here, but this place is doomed, even if few recognize it.

Of course, the most important kind of stories are the ones that you and your players enjoy. Your best option is often to ask your players what type of game they would like to play and go from there.

## Setting the Mood

Whether a ballad or a requiem, there is a certain mood to the stories of the Archipelago: that of Soft Horror.

- Soft Horror often means leaving the most terrifying bits unspoken.
- All seems well, but under the surface something is horribly wrong here.
- Create cracks in the narrative for doubt and fear to come creeping in.
- Use comic relief to lighten the mood – and consequences to dampen it.
- Themes of hope are not out of place – contrast is good.
- Karst is dying but the characters should feel alive.

## Scenes and Altercations

When running scenes and (especially) altercations, you will often need to keep things moving. Try not to let the players get too caught up in one thing or another, unless the whole group is engaged and it adds to the story. In a similar manner, it’s up to you to cut to the chase when narrating. Don’t waste time drawing out events or playing through what happens between more impactful scenes, but also don’t hand wave it all away or leave everything to the imagination; a short description of background events can make the transition between scenes more natural and fill in important details without interrupting the course of play.

Another way in which you can keep the story flowing is by not calling for action rolls very often – especially when characters already have a relevant knack, ability, or item. This has the benefit of encouraging creative problem solving and empowering the players. When the players think in terms of who their characters are rather than their statistical odds of success, the story comes alive.

## Actions

Creative player action is what drives the story; nurturing it is your foremost job. The role of the narrator is rarely to oppose actions, but to enable them and determine their outcome; particularly, what new opportunities arise as the result of each action.

You are always at liberty to say no to a proposed action, but reserve this for the obvious cases.

## Actions & Rolls

Much of the action can be handled without the need for dice, but action rolls offer the opportunity to add uncertainty and risk to situations.

At their core, action rolls are meant to be simple: roll a six (or more) to succeed.

The most common action roll, a one in six chance, is used any time a character wants to attempt something implausible, but not impossible. These are the situations where action rolls shine the most.

For simpler tasks, something with even odds, a bonus of two is added to the roll. When the story and dialog is flowing, these rolls can often be forgotten in favor of storytelling and creative roleplaying.

For almost guaranteed tasks – often not worth rolling for at all – a bonus of four may be added. This can be useful for situations with small, but catastrophic, levels of risk. Four is also the highest practical modifier, as no matter what, a roll of one is a failure.

Knacks, especially basic and expert knacks, often grant bonuses to certain action rolls. Basic knacks add a bonus of two to any relevant rolls and expert knacks extend the bonus to four. Outside of tense or time-sensitive situations, you should avoid calling for action rolls when a character has the relevant knack.

Characters with a specific knack may also attempt certain actions that others can not: things that are almost impossible. In these attempts, no modifier is granted to those with the relevant knack. Those without, fail automatically.

Some actions can not be performed without a certain item; other actions can be aided by items. When used, a relevant item can either enable an otherwise impossible action roll or add a bonus of one to an already possible roll.

## Everyone Else

Friends, allies, the opposition, bystanders, and neutral parties – almost everyone but the players’ characters – are your responsibility. Remember, each of these characters has their own goals and motivations. It can be difficult to juggle every last one of them in addition to your other tasks, so consider jotting down a few words about any characters that the players may interact with beforehand. Even a word or two to describe their appearance, personality, or motivation can go a long way towards making a character feel more lifelike and easier to improvise. Any details you come up with while playing are also worth writing down for future reference – if you have to do so in the moment or can remember to afterward.

Characters are complex; you can’t be expected to prepare their every reaction and response in advance. Folk often act in a surprising manner; take advantage of this fact as you come up with your responses to player actions and questions. The players don’t need to know what you have and haven’t prepared in advance – nor will they usually be able to tell.

A note about the characters you control and altercations. It is important to remember that very few beings will fight to the death, nor will they fight fairly. Many will retreat, surrender, or attempt to bargain when an altercation turns against their favor. Likewise, the opposition should often employ creative tactics and strategies – many altercations are a battle of wits as well as brawn.

### Others

Many of the characters that the players encounter will be folk, but there are other creatures, beings, and beasts in the world. Collectively, these characters are known as Others. Most others can be described by a handful of words and a few statistics, such as health, defense, attack damage, and any particular behaviors.

You can find a number of others in the adventure **Shipwrecked on Gyglos Island** and similar publications of the **Karst Archipelago Historical Society**. Creatures from other games and systems can be converted into Karst with a small bit of effort and judgement.

## Travel & Time

Much of the logistics around timekeeping are left up to your tastes, but the suggested method of tracking time is an hourly system. In this system, it is assumed that characters can spend about eight hours a day actively adventuring. Those who wish to push on can adventure for up to twelve hours, but will be fatigued the next day, subtracting one from all rolls.

To keep things simple, it can also be assumed that all activities take at least one hour to perform. Some activities may take multiple hours or even longer, such as journeys over land or sea, which can be measured in hours, days, or even weeks, as appropriate.

At a smaller scale, activities can be broken down into ten minute intervals, something that can be useful when exploring areas. The length of a scene or altercation is left deliberately vague and flexible. Rounds within an altercation last about ten seconds, but could be as long as a minute or as short as an instant in some situations.

## Character Progression

There are no hard and fast rules about when and how to award new levels of experience to the players’ characters. Karst does not have a complicated or detailed method of tracking character progression beyond level, so you will have to use a bit of your own judgement.

As the story is the central building block in Karst, it is easiest to tie character advancement to the completion of stories. The conclusion of an adventure – or shortly thereafter – is often the most logical time for such improvements to occur. Other times, it may make sense for characters to advance midway through a larger story – again, often after an important accomplishment, plot development, or the end of a chapter.

Characters in Karst are designed to grow from the first level to the tenth level across the span of their career. While this should not be an issue for most games, you may need to keep this in mind for particularly long running sagas. Often you will find that by the time their characters have reached the upper levels of experience, your players will want to move onto to something new, but if not, there are ways you can keep the game going.

There’s nothing stopping you from playing beyond the tenth level. If you need more content, there are plenty of games with spells and abilities that can be used in Karst with a little bit of conversion. For higher level play, you can extend the progression of odd-level knacks and introduce Master knacks, available only to characters above the tenth level.

## Magic Items

Advancement in level isn’t the only way that characters can be rewarded and become more capable at the same time. Magic items are another meaningful form of reward, as well as an opportunity for storytelling and world building. Adventures can center around magical items, including quests to recover them, or missions to prevent their misuse. These powerful pieces of lore and plot are a great incentive, excuse, or reward to entice, cajole, or delight your players.

Mechanically, magic items behave in a straightforward manner and are quick to create on the fly. Broadly, there are two types of magic items: those that grant modifiers and those that grant powers. Some magic items grant both modifiers and powers or more than one of each, though these are considerably more rare.

Modifiers add to or subtract from rolls. Typical modifiers range from one to four and compliment an item’s function, but there are exceptions. Powers are different; most have similar effects to specific spells or knacks. The power granted by a magic item may be used some finite number of times, a number of times per day, or even at will – in the case of more powerful items.

Not all magic items are beneficial. Some are cursed, while others may offer a dubious mix of boons and complications. The powers and modifiers granted by a magical item may be negative. Cursed items are often deceptive and difficult to remove once equipped; magic, or a strong will may be needed to overcome or remove their effects.

## Treasure

Magic items aren’t the only form of treasure that characters can find. Jewelry, gems, coins, and other precious items are other “common” forms of treasure. The monetary value of these treasures can be tailored to fit the scope of your story, but many treasures are priceless – to the right folk. These kinds of treasures, or other unique items, can often play an important role in a plot.

Just as some treasures are precious to other folk in the game, so too may there be treasures that the players’ characters are after. If the players express interest in something, or have created some kind of reward in their own mind, take it and run with it; player motivation is a powerful force. Lastly, if you don’t know how else to start a story, a treasure hunt is a time-honored way to kick things off while leaving room for all kinds of directions.

## Other Content

Karst, the game, is but one island in a grand archipelago of games and stories. These rules and words were crafted and informed by one person’s journey across that sea – much within these pages owe it to those distant shores. Through these connections, these reflections of other games and systems, you may begin to see paths through which the creations inside of those worlds may walk into the world of Karst.

Beyond even those waters, there is the grand idea of the story, something that unites us as humans. Within everything is a story, and within every story is inspiration for another; you never know where you will find ideas if you take the time to look.

## Final Thoughts

More than anything, the role of the Narrator is to help people have fun. These rules, this advice, the whole Karst setting, and every other role playing book and tool out there are just that: tools, resources, and advice for **you** to take and do with as you see fit.

The words and tools that you have found helpful, you should keep; feel free to discard the rest. Make it yours, share it with others, help them have fun. Just as importantly, make sure that _you_ are having fun. Your role is to help people have fun, and you’re people too, after all.
